                                            minta tolong di translate ke bahasa indonesia yang jelas dan baik:The chilling survey of North Korea’s cyberpower in The Times, describing a sophisticated program of not only weapons of war but also of theft, blackmail, harassment and score-settling, is shocking, but not surprising. Kim Jong-un is ruthless in his quest for power and survival, and hacking, even more than the nuclear power North Korea is rapidly developing, is the perfect weapon for a small, impoverished, isolated, totalitarian state.Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons pose an enormous threat to the United States and its Asian allies. But even a megalomaniac like Mr. Kim understands that unleashing them would spell a hellish end to him and his country. Cyberweapons, by contrast, offer a degree of stealth and deniability and a broad range of uses, as David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick and Nicole Perlroth detailed in their article. North Korea has used its army of hackers for assaults as diverse as multimillion-dollar digital bank robberies, the giant WannaCry ransomware attack (based on a secret tool stolen from the National Security Agency) and attacks on movie producers and television networks to force them to cancel projects deemed hostile by North Korea.Mr. Kim’s total control over his country gives him his pick of the best young brains to train as hackers; the cost is relatively low, and effective retaliation has so far proved very difficult. North Korea is already under every possible international sanction, its infrastructure is too primitive for useful cyberretaliation, and neither the United States nor South Korea would likely launch a military attack. And North Korean hackers appear to operate largely outside the country, especially in China and India.</a>

                                            Violent video games really have bad impacts. They may contribute to youth violence. Increasing reports of bullying can be partially attributed to the popularity of violent video games. The 2008 study Grand Theft Childhood reported that 60% of middle school boys who played at least one mature- rated game hit or beat up someone, compared to 39% of boys that did not play mature-rated games. Violent video games desensitize players to real-life violence. It is common for victims in video games to disappear off when they are killed or for players to have multiple players level. The games might teach youth that violence is an acceptable conflict-solving strategy and an appropriate way to achieve one's goals. A 2009 study found that youth who play violent games have lower belief in the use of nonviolent strategies and are less forgiving than players of nonviolent video games. Violent video games cause players to associate pleasure and happiness with the ability to cause pain in others. Young children are more likely to confuse fantasy violence with real world violence, and without a framework for ethical decision making, they may mimic the actions they see in violent video games. Playing video games increases aggressive behavior and arousal. A 2009 study found that it takes up to four minutes for the level of aggressive thoughts and feelings in children to return to normal after playing violent video games. It takes five to ten minutes for heart rate and aggressive behavior to return to baseline. Video games that show the most blood generate more aggressive thoughts. When blood is present in video games, there is a measurable increase in arousal and ⁷hostility. From the facts mentioned above, it is clear that violent games really contribute to the youth violence. 1. What is the suitable title for this text?2. Which is the writer's argument from these following statements? A. Violent video games definitely should be banned, B. Parents should attend their children when playing video games. C. Violent video games have increased the risk of heart unhappiness. D. Children might settle their dispute using physical harassment. E. Playing video games too much is bad for brain development. 3.

                                            Read the text and answer question below! Bullying and cyber bullying are two major problems that young teens and adults have. These two things are not the same, but they do in fact intersect one another. Lots of people are committing suicide every year just because of this problem. It starts online then it can lead to neighborhoods or even at your own house. An important key to know if you're being bullied, is to talk to someone about it, don't keep it to yourself. Cyber bullying happens on many of the common places online. This includes places like MySpace or Facebook, but it's also common in chats, instant messaging, and emails and on message boards. It's really important to think before you post anything personal about yourself online. The same thing goes for if you are being bullied on a school campus. Talk to someone about it. Or just stay near an instructor or someone where safe. When people are being bullied online or on campus, it hurts them and they can go into the stage of stress or depression. They might feel lost and they don't know what to do about it. That's when they can't trust anyone, and they become lonely. The worst part of it is when people find them dead. It's a tragedy! Many people and family members have lots of unanswered questions. Of course, everyone wants to know who is involved, so they call the police immediately to investigate.Bullying and even cyberbullying is everywhere no matter the grade or age. It is in elementary schools, middle school, high schools and even college. Bullies think life would be a lot better if all the people they harass would not be here. But the people who were bullied, I know for a fact if they were still here, they would also have a better life if the ones who started the bullying faced several punishments. Parents and teachers need to be more aware when it comes to being bullied. No matter if it's online or on school grounds. If teachers or faculty members see someone getting bullied they should take the bullies to the principal's office for a talk on the harm they are causing. The same thing goes for parents, if they know that their child or children are being bullied, they need to do something about it.1.From the text it can be inferred that cyberbullying... A.is more dangerous than school bullying. B.may lead to identity theft. C.could face jail under harassment law. D.starts at home. D.may happen to children.2.According to the text, which of the following statements is INCORRECT? A.Bullying should be acted upon by all sides.B. Many bully-victims ended their lives. C.Bullies need to talk about their problems to teachers. D.Giving bullies punishments will relieve victims of bullying. E.It is teachers' job to take action on bullies at school.3.Which of the following shows the author's recommendation? A.Parents and teachers need to be more aware when it comes to being bullied. B.They might feel lost and they don't know what to do about it. C.When people are being bullied online or on campus, it hurts them and they can go into the stage of stress depression.

                                            Cyberbullying refers to bullying that takes place through interactive technology, particularly through the internet. It includes insults, embarrassment, and harassment. I think cyberbullying is dangerous because of some reasons. Firstly, cyberbullying is anonymous People can be cyberbullied by a stranger or a close acquaintance without ever being able to tell who the culpritis. Bullies may feel empowered to say and do more destructive things than they would face-to-face when they are interacting with their victims Secondly, cyberbullying is permanent. It can be really impossible to rid the internet of offensive material that a cyberbully makes public; once a photo, rumor, or video has made it into a cyberspace, it may be there forever. Thirdly, cyberbullying is public. It can escalate what might once have been schoolyard an email to friends who forward it further or to re-post or re-tweet a bullying for the bullying to go viral" and reach a large audience. Lastly, cyberbullying is omnipresent. It follows you home. A student being bullied at school may find refuge in other spaces, but a victim of cyberbullying is connected to his or her tormentors whenever he or she is connected to a cell phone or computer--which for many teens is all the time.

                                            Is Social Media Harmful?
Zachary Meyer. 7 October 2021
In recent times social media has become more and more popular, it has even led to the growth of many billion-dollar companies.
With every light there is a shade, like that although there are many positive factors about social media like business growth, enriching connectivity, news, and much more. It also comes with many dangers like cyber safety, human trafficking, fake news, and many more.
As a social media user, it is important that you know about these dangers so that you can keep yourself and your society safe.
Fake News
With the advent of social media, it has now become way easier to propagate fake news, with just a single click fake news gets shared to millions of users online.
This propagation of uncontrolled news has created more violence and hatred among people. In fact, this fake propaganda has even affected the election results of many countries.
It has become so serious that many governments are now formulating laws to curtail fake news. Because of its lack of accountability and credibility, social media has now become a breeding ground for fake news.
Cyber Bullying
With the anonymous nature of the conversation, social media has now made it easier for many anti-social elements to indulge in cyberbullying.
The cases of online harassment and improper unsolicited messaging are increasing year on year because of social media usage.
Cyberbullying has gone to an extreme level unbearable news, that there are even cases where victims take their own life or indulge in unnecessary acts of violence because of this issue.
Privacy Theft
Even now there is not much awareness among people about the importance of privacy. Many teenagers are posting their data without knowing its repercussions.
There are many cases where these data are stolen and used by perpetrators to harass the victims. Most of the victims in this category are teenagers. It's important to understand what you're posting online and where.
Increase in Anti-Social Behavior
Although there are thousands of friends on social media, in reality, the person would not be conversing with any of them.
Social media has made it really difficult for people to get into a real-time face-to-face conversation or making connections with peers offline. Instead of speaking in a real-time environment, people have now started to speak in comments and status.
Depression
If you look closely, you can see that the people online typically share the best things about themselves and their lives. This gives us normal people a false sense of reality and may plague us to believe negative things about ourselves because our lives aren't as exciting as what we see from others being broadcasted online.
There is an overwhelming amount of evidence coming out today arguing that social media is actually harming our youth and causing certain levels of depression and anxiety.
Social media has also increased the attention-seeking nature of individuals and their life gets affected when they are not feeling that attention. Many of us seek likes on our photos and threads, we crave the attention that we see others getting.
Addictive
Finally, social media is more addictive than it seems to be. There are people who update status and check comments every minute, 24 hours a day. They don’t understand that it is a waste of time and is affecting the quality of their life.
Conclusion
In short social media is like a double-edged sword, it has both advantages and disadvantages. As a user, it is our responsibility to use this medium to our own benefits. We should also understand the effect of our actions on social media and we should use it cautiously so that it does not affect anyone in a negative manner.

                                            Nowadays, many people can connect with other people by using social media such as facebook, twitter, path, etc. So, online etiquettes are definitely needed to prevent any misunderstanding, disputes, harassment and crime. Firstly, you do not have to add friends on your social media if you don't know them well or speak to them only occasionally. We must keep in mind that a stranger might harm you. Secondly, you do not have to post photos of other people drunk, drinking or doing other nonsense. Your entire life doesn't need to be uploaded to a public website that other people can see. But, you can still take and keep your pictures privately. Thirdly, you have to be careful when you want to post something on your friend's walls. You do not need to write inappropriate things. It may look funny for you, but it can just look bad to others. You know that social media is a good place for discussions. You can share the good things, but the bad things should be done elsewhere. This can make everyone use online etiquette. 4.What is the text about? 5.But, you can still take and keep your pictures privately." (Paragraph 2) What does the underlined word mean?​</a>

The increasing number of people significantly report alleged s3xual harassment at educational institutions to the authorities according to the National Commission on Violence against women.
Between 2015 and 2020, the authorities received about 51 cases of s3xual assaults that occurred in certain academic institutions. Based on the data, the most common perpetrators who committed the assaults were teachers and Muslim preachers. Generally, victims of s3xual abuse have the tendency to encounter an exhausting and difficult process in the legal systems.
Ultimately, the cases would reach a dead end and would not make any progress to the court, and it is very disappointing especially for the victims and their family.</a>

                            13. minta tolong di translate ke bahasa indonesia yang jelas dan baik:The chilling survey of North Korea’s cyberpower in The Times, describing a sophisticated program of not only weapons of war but also of theft, blackmail, harassment and score-settling, is shocking, but not surprising. Kim Jong-un is ruthless in his quest for power and survival, and hacking, even more than the nuclear power North Korea is rapidly developing, is the perfect weapon for a small, impoverished, isolated, totalitarian state.Pyongyang’s nuclear weapons pose an enormous threat to the United States and its Asian allies. But even a megalomaniac like Mr. Kim understands that unleashing them would spell a hellish end to him and his country. Cyberweapons, by contrast, offer a degree of stealth and deniability and a broad range of uses, as David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick and Nicole Perlroth detailed in their article. North Korea has used its army of hackers for assaults as diverse as multimillion-dollar digital bank robberies, the giant WannaCry ransomware attack (based on a secret tool stolen from the National Security Agency) and attacks on movie producers and television networks to force them to cancel projects deemed hostile by North Korea.Mr. Kim’s total control over his country gives him his pick of the best young brains to train as hackers; the cost is relatively low, and effective retaliation has so far proved very difficult. North Korea is already under every possible international sanction, its infrastructure is too primitive for useful cyberretaliation, and neither the United States nor South Korea would likely launch a military attack. And North Korean hackers appear to operate largely outside the country, especially in China and India.</h2><br />
                        Survei mengerikan terhadap cyberpower Korea Utara di The Times, yang menggambarkan sebuah program canggih tidak hanya senjata perang tapi juga pencurian, pemerasan, pelecehan dan penyelesaian nilai, mengejutkan, tapi tidak mengherankan. Kim Jong-un adalah orang yang kejam dalam usahanya mencari kekuatan dan kelangsungan hidup, dan hacking, bahkan lebih dari sekedar kekuatan nuklir Korea Utara yang berkembang pesat, adalah senjata yang sempurna untuk sebuah negara kecil yang total, miskin, terisolasi, totaliter.<br /><br />Senjata nuklir Pyongyang merupakan ancaman besar bagi Amerika Serikat dan sekutunya di Asia. Tetapi bahkan megalomaniak seperti Mr Kim mengerti bahwa melepaskan mereka akan mengeja akhir yang mengerikan baginya dan negaranya. Sebaliknya, Cyberweapons menawarkan tingkat siluman dan penyangkalan dan penggunaan yang luas, seperti David Sanger, David Kirkpatrick dan Nicole Perlroth dalam artikel mereka. Korea Utara telah menggunakan tentaranya hacker untuk melakukan serangan yang beragam seperti perampokan bank digital bernilai jutaan dolar, serangan ransomware raksasa WannaCry (berdasarkan sebuah alat rahasia yang dicuri dari Badan Keamanan Nasional) dan serangan terhadap produsen film dan jaringan televisi untuk memaksa mereka ke membatalkan proyek yang dianggap bermusuhan oleh Korea Utara.<br /><br />Kontrol total Kim atas negaranya memberinya pilihan otak muda terbaik untuk dilatih sebagai hacker; biayanya relatif rendah, dan pembalasan efektif sejauh ini terbukti sangat sulit. Korea Utara sudah berada di bawah setiap sanksi internasional yang mungkin, infrastrukturnya terlalu primitif untuk cyberallaliation yang berguna, dan baik Amerika Serikat maupun Korea Selatan kemungkinan akan melancarkan serangan militer.

                            15. Violent video games really have bad impacts. They may contribute to youth violence. Increasing reports of bullying can be partially attributed to the popularity of violent video games. The 2008 study Grand Theft Childhood reported that 60% of middle school boys who played at least one mature- rated game hit or beat up someone, compared to 39% of boys that did not play mature-rated games. Violent video games desensitize players to real-life violence. It is common for victims in video games to disappear off when they are killed or for players to have multiple players level. The games might teach youth that violence is an acceptable conflict-solving strategy and an appropriate way to achieve one's goals. A 2009 study found that youth who play violent games have lower belief in the use of nonviolent strategies and are less forgiving than players of nonviolent video games. Violent video games cause players to associate pleasure and happiness with the ability to cause pain in others. Young children are more likely to confuse fantasy violence with real world violence, and without a framework for ethical decision making, they may mimic the actions they see in violent video games. Playing video games increases aggressive behavior and arousal. A 2009 study found that it takes up to four minutes for the level of aggressive thoughts and feelings in children to return to normal after playing violent video games. It takes five to ten minutes for heart rate and aggressive behavior to return to baseline. Video games that show the most blood generate more aggressive thoughts. When blood is present in video games, there is a measurable increase in arousal and ⁷hostility. From the facts mentioned above, it is clear that violent games really contribute to the youth violence. 1. What is the suitable title for this text?2. Which is the writer's argument from these following statements? A. Violent video games definitely should be banned, B. Parents should attend their children when playing video games. C. Violent video games have increased the risk of heart unhappiness. D. Children might settle their dispute using physical harassment. E. Playing video games too much is bad for brain development. 3.

B. teach children how to solve their problems quickly.C. confuse children between fantasy and real- world violence. D. are imitated by children by acting like the games' characters.

                            16. Read the text and answer question below! Bullying and cyber bullying are two major problems that young teens and adults have. These two things are not the same, but they do in fact intersect one another. Lots of people are committing suicide every year just because of this problem. It starts online then it can lead to neighborhoods or even at your own house. An important key to know if you're being bullied, is to talk to someone about it, don't keep it to yourself. Cyber bullying happens on many of the common places online. This includes places like MySpace or Facebook, but it's also common in chats, instant messaging, and emails and on message boards. It's really important to think before you post anything personal about yourself online. The same thing goes for if you are being bullied on a school campus. Talk to someone about it. Or just stay near an instructor or someone where safe. When people are being bullied online or on campus, it hurts them and they can go into the stage of stress or depression. They might feel lost and they don't know what to do about it. That's when they can't trust anyone, and they become lonely. The worst part of it is when people find them dead. It's a tragedy! Many people and family members have lots of unanswered questions. Of course, everyone wants to know who is involved, so they call the police immediately to investigate.Bullying and even cyberbullying is everywhere no matter the grade or age. It is in elementary schools, middle school, high schools and even college. Bullies think life would be a lot better if all the people they harass would not be here. But the people who were bullied, I know for a fact if they were still here, they would also have a better life if the ones who started the bullying faced several punishments. Parents and teachers need to be more aware when it comes to being bullied. No matter if it's online or on school grounds. If teachers or faculty members see someone getting bullied they should take the bullies to the principal's office for a talk on the harm they are causing. The same thing goes for parents, if they know that their child or children are being bullied, they need to do something about it.1.From the text it can be inferred that cyberbullying... A.is more dangerous than school bullying. B.may lead to identity theft. C.could face jail under harassment law. D.starts at home. D.may happen to children.2.According to the text, which of the following statements is INCORRECT? A.Bullying should be acted upon by all sides.B. Many bully-victims ended their lives. C.Bullies need to talk about their problems to teachers. D.Giving bullies punishments will relieve victims of bullying. E.It is teachers' job to take action on bullies at school.3.Which of the following shows the author's recommendation? A.Parents and teachers need to be more aware when it comes to being bullied. B.They might feel lost and they don't know what to do about it. C.When people are being bullied online or on campus, it hurts them and they can go into the stage of stress depression.

                            18. Cyberbullying refers to bullying that takes place through interactive technology, particularly through the internet. It includes insults, embarrassment, and harassment. I think cyberbullying is dangerous because of some reasons. Firstly, cyberbullying is anonymous People can be cyberbullied by a stranger or a close acquaintance without ever being able to tell who the culpritis. Bullies may feel empowered to say and do more destructive things than they would face-to-face when they are interacting with their victims Secondly, cyberbullying is permanent. It can be really impossible to rid the internet of offensive material that a cyberbully makes public; once a photo, rumor, or video has made it into a cyberspace, it may be there forever. Thirdly, cyberbullying is public. It can escalate what might once have been schoolyard an email to friends who forward it further or to re-post or re-tweet a bullying for the bullying to go viral" and reach a large audience. Lastly, cyberbullying is omnipresent. It follows you home. A student being bullied at school may find refuge in other spaces, but a victim of cyberbullying is connected to his or her tormentors whenever he or she is connected to a cell phone or computer--which for many teens is all the time. Based on those reasons above, it is obvious that cyberbullying is dangerous. disputes into smear campaigns accessible to the whole world.

                            23. Is Social Media Harmful?
Zachary Meyer. 7 October 2021
In recent times social media has become more and more popular, it has even led to the growth of many billion-dollar companies.
With every light there is a shade, like that although there are many positive factors about social media like business growth, enriching connectivity, news, and much more. It also comes with many dangers like cyber safety, human trafficking, fake news, and many more.
As a social media user, it is important that you know about these dangers so that you can keep yourself and your society safe.
Fake News
With the advent of social media, it has now become way easier to propagate fake news, with just a single click fake news gets shared to millions of users online.
This propagation of uncontrolled news has created more violence and hatred among people. In fact, this fake propaganda has even affected the election results of many countries.
It has become so serious that many governments are now formulating laws to curtail fake news. Because of its lack of accountability and credibility, social media has now become a breeding ground for fake news.
Cyber Bullying
With the anonymous nature of the conversation, social media has now made it easier for many anti-social elements to indulge in cyberbullying.
The cases of online harassment and improper unsolicited messaging are increasing year on year because of social media usage.
Cyberbullying has gone to an extreme level unbearable news, that there are even cases where victims take their own life or indulge in unnecessary acts of violence because of this issue.
Privacy Theft
Even now there is not much awareness among people about the importance of privacy. Many teenagers are posting their data without knowing its repercussions.
There are many cases where these data are stolen and used by perpetrators to harass the victims. Most of the victims in this category are teenagers. It's important to understand what you're posting online and where.
Increase in Anti-Social Behavior
Although there are thousands of friends on social media, in reality, the person would not be conversing with any of them.
Social media has made it really difficult for people to get into a real-time face-to-face conversation or making connections with peers offline. Instead of speaking in a real-time environment, people have now started to speak in comments and status.
Depression
If you look closely, you can see that the people online typically share the best things about themselves and their lives. This gives us normal people a false sense of reality and may plague us to believe negative things about ourselves because our lives aren't as exciting as what we see from others being broadcasted online.
There is an overwhelming amount of evidence coming out today arguing that social media is actually harming our youth and causing certain levels of depression and anxiety.
Social media has also increased the attention-seeking nature of individuals and their life gets affected when they are not feeling that attention. Many of us seek likes on our photos and threads, we crave the attention that we see others getting.
Addictive
Finally, social media is more addictive than it seems to be. There are people who update status and check comments every minute, 24 hours a day. They don’t understand that it is a waste of time and is affecting the quality of their life.
Conclusion
In short social media is like a double-edged sword, it has both advantages and disadvantages. As a user, it is our responsibility to use this medium to our own benefits. We should also understand the effect of our actions on social media and we should use it cautiously so that it does not affect anyone in a negative manner.

                            24. Nowadays, many people can connect with other people by using social media such as facebook, twitter, path, etc. So, online etiquettes are definitely needed to prevent any misunderstanding, disputes, harassment and crime. Firstly, you do not have to add friends on your social media if you don't know them well or speak to them only occasionally. We must keep in mind that a stranger might harm you. Secondly, you do not have to post photos of other people drunk, drinking or doing other nonsense. Your entire life doesn't need to be uploaded to a public website that other people can see. But, you can still take and keep your pictures privately. Thirdly, you have to be careful when you want to post something on your friend's walls. You do not need to write inappropriate things. It may look funny for you, but it can just look bad to others. You know that social media is a good place for discussions. You can share the good things, but the bad things should be done elsewhere. This can make everyone use online etiquette. 4.What is the text about? 5.But, you can still take and keep your pictures privately." (Paragraph 2) What does the underlined word mean?​</h2><br />

The increasing number of people significantly report alleged s3xual harassment at educational institutions to the authorities according to the National Commission on Violence against women.
Between 2015 and 2020, the authorities received about 51 cases of s3xual assaults that occurred in certain academic institutions. Based on the data, the most common perpetrators who committed the assaults were teachers and Muslim preachers. Generally, victims of s3xual abuse have the tendency to encounter an exhausting and difficult process in the legal systems.
Ultimately, the cases would reach a dead end and would not make any progress to the court, and it is very disappointing especially for the victims and their family.</h2><br />

                        <p>Mikoriza adalah bentuk simbiosis antara cendawan (fungi) dengan tumbuhan tingkat tinggi (tumbuhan berpembuluh, Tracheophyta), khususnya pada sistem perakaran. Terdapat juga cendawan yang bersimbiosis dengan cendawan lainnya, tetapi sebutan mikoriza biasanya adalah untuk simbiosis cendawan yang menginfeksi akar tumbuhan. Bentuk simbiosis ini terutama adalah simbiosis mutualisme, meskipun pada beberapa kasus dapat berupa simbiosis parasitisme lemah.</p><p></p><p>Mikoriza merupakan gejala umum pada perakaran tumbuhan.
