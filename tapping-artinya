                                            As the teacher brought the class back from the washroom, he noticed that Alvin and Elijah were nowhere to be seen. He asked the class, "Has anyone seen Alvin or Elijah?" Most of the students confirmed that they had not seen them, except for Rodney, who remained silent while tapping his foot on the floor anxiously. The teacher noticed this. "Rodney, do you happen to know where your best buddies Alvin and Elijah went?" Rodney looked away and said, "Nah, I haven't seen them." The teacher notified the office of the missing students. An announcement was made over the PA system and a few minutes later, Alvin and Elijah returned to class. Both of them were very sweaty and Elijah was carrying a basketball. "Sorry we took so long. We had to use the bathroom," said Elijah. "Yeah," chimed in Alvin, "it took longer than we thought."
 1. What were Alvin and Elijah doing while they were gone?
 2. Why was Rodney acting so strangely?
 3. Will the teacher believe Alvin and Elijah's story</a>

                                            B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, ground clamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded. 2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt, pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 3. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surface to weld on. 4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should most likely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted for metal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding, depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be welded with a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible. 7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely and firmly held together. 8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up or striking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes the electricity to jump from the electrode to the metal. 9. Build up a weld pool When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electro and instead watch the pool of molten metal. 10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degr 11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to co. shy of 90 The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slacy. Slag is a retidue left from the welding process. During the weld protects the hot metal from contaminants. 13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. Howe practice changes this Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool, Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structural welds to cool by air instead. ​</a>

Thank you for sending us the sample posters for our upcoming badminton match. In my opinion, the first poster is 1. ... than the second one, but the third is the funniest. I think the third poster is 2. ... of the three. It has the 3. ... slogan. But I think we 4. ... the celebrity photo. Even without it, the poster is still 5. ... than the other two. But that's just my opinion. Let's hear the comments of the other members at the next committee meeting at Hafiz's place.
To go to Hafiz' house, you 6. ... take the TransJakarta (TJ) bus. First, you should go to the nearest TJ bus shelter and 7. ... an e-money card there. You 8. ... fill the e-money card with an initial amount of Rp. 40,000. Then, tap the card at the gate to get into the waiting area. When you leave the shelter at your destination, you 9. ... your card at the gate again. But if you have a taxi provider application on your cell phone, you 10. ... go through the process of taking a TJ bus. OK, see you at Hafiz's house, Endah. Cheerio,

                                            Government should not raise fuel price to solve the problem of economic issues. People were affected severely with the high fuel price hike last year. Obviously they cut their spending. As an example, they had to buy lower quality of rice or palm oil. What is the purpose of the announcement? There were also fewer buyers of secondary commodities like flour, or canned meat or fish.Furthermore, the condition of low income family will become even worse because their expenses will increase while their salaries will not. Many companies will have to trim the number of employees because they are incapable of managing buying or selling price, standard wages and personal affairs.Finally, government should not raise fuel price to overcome economic problem but the solution should be sought by tapping into the nation's own potential and utilizing it to enhance productivity to its maximum.</a>

                                            One day, the mouse deer, an animal that he said was smart, was walking on the edge of the forest. Since it was too dark in the forest because the trees were also very dense, he just wanted to get some fresh air while watching the bright sun shine. The Kancil wanted to bask in the sun for a while. Precisely after arriving at the edge of a large river, he felt his stomach was very hungry."Krucuk ... krucuk ..." that's about the sound of the mouse deer's stomach that was feeling hungry. Then, the mouse deer imagined  how good it would be if he ate his favorite food, namely cucumber. But unfortunately, the cucumber garden that bears fruit is on the other side of the big river. The mouse deer was silent and thought about how to cross this big river huh...The mouse deer kept thinking about how he could cross this big river without having to touch the cold and swift water. Suddenly, the mouse deer looked at several crocodiles who were sunbathing on the river bank. It is their habit to sunbathe, especially when the sun is hot like this. Without waiting for a long time, the mouse deer immediately approached one of the crocodiles that was sunbathing."Hi crocodile, how are you today?"Crocodile, who at that time was still enjoying the sunlight, then opened his eyes and found that there was Si Kancil who was greeting. "I'm well. What are you doing here?” asked Crocodile to Si Kancil."I'm here to bring good news to you and your herd," answered Si Kancil with a happy face. Hearing these words, of course Crocodile couldn't wait to hear the good news meant by Si Kancil. “Immediately tell me what the good news is!”The hare then said, "I came here because we were ordered by the King of the Forest to count the number of crocodiles in this river, because the King of the Jungle wants to give gifts to you and all of your herds..." Hearing the name of the King of the Forest, of course, immediately made Crocodile believe him. the talk. "All right, Mouse Deer. You wait herefirst, I will go down to the bottom of the river to call all my flock, said Crocodile, immediately crawled quickly to the bottom of the river. While waiting for Crocodile and the other herds to arrive, Si Kancil was dreaming of having his favorite cucumber soon. Not long after, all the crocodiles that were originally at the bottom of the river had gathered on the river bank. The mouse deer then started the conversation again, "Hey crocodiles. I'm here because I've been ordered by the King of the Forest to count all of you. Because, the King of the Forest wants to give all of you a special gift today. Therefore, line up all of you from this cliff to the cliff over there…”Hearing an order related to the King of the Forest, of course, immediately made the crocodiles carry it out without arguing. They immediately lined up neatly in accordance with Si Kancil's orders. "Well Kancil, now count us all," said one of the biggest crocodiles.The hare then took a piece of wood that was around it and then jumped onto the body of the first crocodile on the bank of the river. He started counting by saying, "One two three dents, male and female I tapped", while tapping the crocodile's head until he managed to cross the big river. After arriving at the opposite bank of the river, the mouse deer immediately jumped for joy and said, "Hey crocodiles, do you know that I actually don't bring good news from the King of the Forest? Actually I have tricked all of you to be able to cross this great river. Ha…ha…ha…” Seeing the hare laughing while saying that, the crocodiles felt both angry and embarrassed because they had been deceived by the hare. "You are naughty and cunning Kancil. Watch out for you... If we meet again, I'll eat you!” said one of the crocodiles.The hare was not at all afraid of this threat and immediately ran for joy leaving the crocodiles to immediately head for the juicy cucumber garden. He immediately relieved hunger in the cucumber garden.1. carilah irregular Verb dan regular Verb masing" 20 ​</a>

                                            B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, groundclamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded."2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt,pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 33. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surfaceto weld on.t4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should mostlikely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted formetal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding,depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be weldedwith a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible.7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely andfirmly held together.8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up orstriking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes theelectricity to jump from the electrode to the metal.9. Build up a weld pool. When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electrodeand instead watch the pool of molten metal.10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degreesshy of 90°11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to cool.The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slag. Slag is a residue left from the welding process. During the weld, the slagprotects the hot metal from contaminants.13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. However,practice changes this. Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool. Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structuralwelds to cool by air instead.​ </a>

                            5. As the teacher brought the class back from the washroom, he noticed that Alvin and Elijah were nowhere to be seen. He asked the class, "Has anyone seen Alvin or Elijah?" Most of the students confirmed that they had not seen them, except for Rodney, who remained silent while tapping his foot on the floor anxiously. The teacher noticed this. "Rodney, do you happen to know where your best buddies Alvin and Elijah went?" Rodney looked away and said, "Nah, I haven't seen them." The teacher notified the office of the missing students. An announcement was made over the PA system and a few minutes later, Alvin and Elijah returned to class. Both of them were very sweaty and Elijah was carrying a basketball. "Sorry we took so long. We had to use the bathroom," said Elijah. "Yeah," chimed in Alvin, "it took longer than we thought."

                            8. B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, ground clamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded. 2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt, pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 3. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surface to weld on. 4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should most likely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted for metal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding, depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be welded with a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible. 7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely and firmly held together. 8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up or striking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes the electricity to jump from the electrode to the metal. 9. Build up a weld pool When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electro and instead watch the pool of molten metal. 10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degr 11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to co. shy of 90 The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slacy. Slag is a retidue left from the welding process. During the weld protects the hot metal from contaminants. 13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. Howe practice changes this Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool, Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structural welds to cool by air instead. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Jawaban:</strong></p><p>B. Cara Mengelas Besi</p><p> 1. Kumpulkan materi Anda.  Anda harus memiliki mesin las, tempat elektroda dengan timah, penjepit tanah dengan timah, elektroda, dan logam untuk dilas.</p><p></p><p> 2. Kenakan perlengkapan keselamatan Anda.  Ini termasuk helm las, jaket las atau kaus katun, celana tanpa manset, sepatu bot kerja, sarung tangan, dan kacamata pengaman.</p><p></p><p> 3. Siapkan area yang akan dilas. Singkirkan semua bahan yang mudah terbakar dan temukan permukaan yang bagus untuk dilas.</p><p></p><p> 4. Siapkan mesin.  Sebagian besar mesin las cukup lurus ke depan.  Anda kemungkinan besar harus menggunakan ampere sekitar 90-120 amp, meskipun ini harus disesuaikan dengan ketebalan logam dan diameter elektroda.</p><p></p><p> 5. Gunakan elektroda yang benar.  Anda harus memilih elektroda yang sesuai untuk pengelasan AC atau DC, tergantung pada mesin Anda.  Pastikan elektroda kering.</p><p></p><p> 6. Bersihkan logam sebelum pengelasan.  Ini dapat dilakukan dengan menyikat permukaan yang akan dilas dengan sikat kawat atau penggiling.  Singkirkan karat atau cat dari logam sebanyak mungkin.</p><p></p><p> 7. Atur sambungannya.  Gunakan penjepit dan pelindung untuk memastikan sambungan yang Anda las terpasang dengan tepat dan kuat.</p><p></p><p> 8. Buat busur las.  Ini dilakukan dengan mengetuk logam dan dengan cepat menarik atau memukulnya seperti korek api.  Anda menyelesaikan rangkaian dan menariknya, yang menyebabkan listrik melompat dari elektroda ke logam.</p><p></p><p> 9. Bangun kolam las Jika busur yang stabil dapat dipertahankan, abaikan ujung elektro dan perhatikan genangan logam cair.</p><p></p><p> 10. Mulai pindahkan kolam las melintasi logam.  Jaga elektroda pada sudut beberapa derajat</p><p></p><p> 11. Selesaikan pengelasan.  Tarik elektroda mundur dari logam dan biarkan beberapa detik hingga menempel.  malu 90 Logam masih akan sangat panas pada saat ini, tetapi seharusnya tidak lagi merah panas.</p><p></p><p> 12. Bersihkan slacy.  Terak merupakan rombongan sisa dari proses pengelasan.  Selama pengelasan melindungi logam panas dari kontaminan.</p><p></p><p> 13. Periksa lasan.  Pengelasan pertama tukang las sering kali buruk dan tidak menghilangkan stres dengan baik.  Bagaimana praktik mengubah ini Lakukan lintasan lain untuk memperbaiki celah atau pengelasan yang tidak lengkap.</p><p></p><p> 14. Biarkan logam menjadi dingin, Pendinginan dalam air akan membuat las rapuh, jadi biarkan semua las struktural mendingin melalui udara.</p><br />

Re: Posters and Hafiz's house
Dear Endah,
Thank you for sending us the sample posters for our upcoming badminton match. In my opinion, the first poster is 1. ... than the second one, but the third is the funniest. I think the third poster is 2. ... of the three. It has the 3. ... slogan. But I think we 4. ... the celebrity photo. Even without it, the poster is still 5. ... than the other two. But that's just my opinion. Let's hear the comments of the other members at the next committee meeting at Hafiz's place.
To go to Hafiz' house, you 6. ... take the TransJakarta (TJ) bus. First, you should go to the nearest TJ bus shelter and 7. ... an e-money card there. You 8. ... fill the e-money card with an initial amount of Rp. 40,000. Then, tap the card at the gate to get into the waiting area. When you leave the shelter at your destination, you 9. ... your card at the gate again. But if you have a taxi provider application on your cell phone, you 10. ... go through the process of taking a TJ bus. OK, see you at Hafiz's house, Endah. Cheerio,
Ridwan.

Orang-orang sangat terpengaruh dengan kenaikan harga bahan bakar yang tinggi tahun lalu.  Jelas mereka memotong pengeluaran mereka.

Ada juga lebih sedikit pembeli komoditas sekunder seperti tepung, atau daging kaleng atau ikan. Selain itu, kondisi keluarga berpenghasilan rendah akan menjadi lebih buruk karena pengeluaran mereka akan meningkat sedangkan gaji mereka tidak.  Banyak perusahaan harus memangkas jumlah karyawan karena mereka tidak mampu mengelola harga beli atau jual, upah standar, dan urusan pribadi.

                            29. One day, the mouse deer, an animal that he said was smart, was walking on the edge of the forest. Since it was too dark in the forest because the trees were also very dense, he just wanted to get some fresh air while watching the bright sun shine. The Kancil wanted to bask in the sun for a while. Precisely after arriving at the edge of a large river, he felt his stomach was very hungry."Krucuk ... krucuk ..." that's about the sound of the mouse deer's stomach that was feeling hungry. Then, the mouse deer imagined  how good it would be if he ate his favorite food, namely cucumber. But unfortunately, the cucumber garden that bears fruit is on the other side of the big river. The mouse deer was silent and thought about how to cross this big river huh...The mouse deer kept thinking about how he could cross this big river without having to touch the cold and swift water. Suddenly, the mouse deer looked at several crocodiles who were sunbathing on the river bank. It is their habit to sunbathe, especially when the sun is hot like this. Without waiting for a long time, the mouse deer immediately approached one of the crocodiles that was sunbathing."Hi crocodile, how are you today?"Crocodile, who at that time was still enjoying the sunlight, then opened his eyes and found that there was Si Kancil who was greeting. "I'm well. What are you doing here?” asked Crocodile to Si Kancil."I'm here to bring good news to you and your herd," answered Si Kancil with a happy face. Hearing these words, of course Crocodile couldn't wait to hear the good news meant by Si Kancil. “Immediately tell me what the good news is!”The hare then said, "I came here because we were ordered by the King of the Forest to count the number of crocodiles in this river, because the King of the Jungle wants to give gifts to you and all of your herds..." Hearing the name of the King of the Forest, of course, immediately made Crocodile believe him. the talk. "All right, Mouse Deer. You wait herefirst, I will go down to the bottom of the river to call all my flock, said Crocodile, immediately crawled quickly to the bottom of the river. While waiting for Crocodile and the other herds to arrive, Si Kancil was dreaming of having his favorite cucumber soon. Not long after, all the crocodiles that were originally at the bottom of the river had gathered on the river bank. The mouse deer then started the conversation again, "Hey crocodiles. I'm here because I've been ordered by the King of the Forest to count all of you. Because, the King of the Forest wants to give all of you a special gift today. Therefore, line up all of you from this cliff to the cliff over there…”Hearing an order related to the King of the Forest, of course, immediately made the crocodiles carry it out without arguing. They immediately lined up neatly in accordance with Si Kancil's orders. "Well Kancil, now count us all," said one of the biggest crocodiles.The hare then took a piece of wood that was around it and then jumped onto the body of the first crocodile on the bank of the river. He started counting by saying, "One two three dents, male and female I tapped", while tapping the crocodile's head until he managed to cross the big river. After arriving at the opposite bank of the river, the mouse deer immediately jumped for joy and said, "Hey crocodiles, do you know that I actually don't bring good news from the King of the Forest? Actually I have tricked all of you to be able to cross this great river. Ha…ha…ha…” Seeing the hare laughing while saying that, the crocodiles felt both angry and embarrassed because they had been deceived by the hare. "You are naughty and cunning Kancil. Watch out for you... If we meet again, I'll eat you!” said one of the crocodiles.The hare was not at all afraid of this threat and immediately ran for joy leaving the crocodiles to immediately head for the juicy cucumber garden. He immediately relieved hunger in the cucumber garden.1. carilah irregular Verb dan regular Verb masing" 20 ​</h2><br />

</p><p>Artinya:</p><p>Pemerintah seharusnya tidak menaikkan harga bahan bakar untuk menyelesaikan masalah-masalah ekonomi. Masyarakat sangat merasakan dampaknya atas kenaikan harga bahan bakar yang tinggi tahun lalu. Jelaslah mereka menggurangi pengeluaran mereka. Sebagai contoh, mereka harus membeli beras atau minyak goreng dengan kualitas lebih rendah. Terjadinya penurunan konsumen terhadap komoditas sekunder seperti tepung, atau daging kalengan atau ikan. Selain itu, kondisi keluarga berpenghasilan rendah akan menjadi lebih buruk karena pengeluaran mereka akan meningkat sedangkan gaji mereka tidak mengalami peningkatan. Banyak perusahaan harus memangkas jumlah karyawan karena mereka tidak mampu mengelola harga beli atau jual, upah standar dan urusan pribadi. Kesimpulannya, pemerintah tidak seharusnya menaikkan harga bahan bakar untuk mengatasi masalah ekonomi tetapi solusinya harus dicari dengan memanfaatkan potensi negara sendiri dan menggunakannya untuk meningkatkan produktivitas secara maksimal.</p><p>--------------------------------------</p>Hortatory Exposition Text1.

                            34. B. How to Weld Iron1. Gather your materials. You should have a welding machine, electrode holder with lead, groundclamp with lead, electrodes, and metal to be welded."2. Put on your safety gear. This includes a welding helmet, welding jacket or cotton sweatshirt,pants without cuffs, work boots, gloves, and safety glasses. 33. Prepare the area to be welded in. Remove all flammable material and find a good surfaceto weld on.t4. Set up the machine. Most welding machines are fairly straight forward. You should mostlikely be using an amperage of around 90-120 amps, although this should be adjusted formetal thickness and electrode diameter.5. Use the correct electrode. You should select the electrode appropriate for AC or DC welding,depending on your machine. Make sure the electrodes are dry.6. Clean the metal before welding. This can be done by brushing the surface(s) to be weldedwith a wire brush or a grinder. Remove as much rust or paint from the metal as possible.7. Set the joint. Use clamps and vises to ensure that the joint you are welding is precisely andfirmly held together.8. Strike a welding arc. This is accomplished by tapping the metal and quickly pulling up orstriking it like a match. You are completing the circuit and pulling away, which causes theelectricity to jump from the electrode to the metal.9. Build up a weld pool. When a stable arc can be maintained, ignore the end of the electrodeand instead watch the pool of molten metal.10. Start moving the weld pool across the metal. Keep the electrode at an angle a few degreesshy of 90°11. Finish the weld. Pull the electrode back from the metal and allow it a few seconds to cool.The metal will still be very hot at this point, but it should no longer be red hot.12. Clean the slag. Slag is a residue left from the welding process. During the weld, the slagprotects the hot metal from contaminants.13. Examine the weld. A welder's first welds are often poor and do not take stress well. However,practice changes this. Make another pass to fix any gaps or incomplete welds.14. Allow the metal to cool. Cooling in water will make the weld brittle, so allow any structuralwelds to cool by air instead.​ </h2><br />

                            38. what is the purpose of the announcement?
Government should not raise fuel price to solve the problem of economic issues. People were affected severely with the high fuel price hike last year. Obviously they cut their spending. As an example, they had to buy lower quality of rice or palm oil. There were also fewer buyers of secondary commodities like flour, or canned meat or fish.Furthermore, the condition of low income family will become even worse because their expenses will increase while their salaries will not. Many companies will have to trim the number of employees because they are incapable of managing buying or selling price, standard wages and personal affairs.Finally, government should not raise fuel price to overcome economic problem but the solution should be sought by tapping into the nation’s own potential and utilizing it to enhance productivity to its maximum.</h2><br />
                        <p>The purpose of the announcement is to tell the government that they should not increase the fuel price because it will affect lots of people life which make them even harder to buy primary commodities and harder to find a job.</p><p></p><p>Hope this help you </p><br />
