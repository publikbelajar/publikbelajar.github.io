                        Ir.Soekarno<br /><br />Actually he is not only a hero, but a great inspiration too. I choose him because I guess he is the great orator who was ever born in Indonesia. Many people were influenced by him until now. But not all people in the world know him, so I want to tell you a story about him.<br /><br />Born in Blitar, East Java, on Jun 10, 1901, He was named Kusno Sosrodihardjo but he was renamed Soekarno because he often got ill. There was a story when he was born. Soekarno was born in the morning , and there was a myth that the child who was born when the sun rises will be predicted to be a big figure on his time. Many people called him Son of the Sun. Stories about his childhood is known that he had a great attitude to communicate with other people.<br /><br />Growth as a talented boy, Soekarno continued his study to HBS in Surabaya. Then he went to Institute of Technology in Bandung (Bandung Institute of Technology) on Civil Department. He spent only 3 years to finish his study. He was not only a smart student but also active in Movement Party called PNI . He was arrested in 1929 by Dutch Colonial Authorities because of his activity in Indonesia Pro-Independence Movement. When he was released, he became a popular hero. He was arrested several times during the 1930’s and was put in jail when Japan occupied the archipelago in 1942.<br /><br />When Japan came to Indonesia, He was still active in Movement Party. On November 10, 1943 Soekarno became the leader of BPUPKI that was supported by Japan. Finally, on August 17, 1945 Indonesia declared the Independence day, and he became the first President of Indonesia.<br /><br />He passed away in 1970 and was buried in Blitar, East Java. Indonesian people were full of sadness. Although he had gone, his spirit is still alive and influences many people until now.<br /><br />Semoga membantu❤<br /><br /><p>My favourite national hero is Raden Adjeng Kartini. Because she was also a pioneer in the area of education for girls and women's rights for Indonesians. <br /><br />She was born into an aristocratic Javanese family when Java was part of the Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. She was born into a family with a strong intellectual tradition. <br /><br />Kartini's family allowed her to attend school until she was 12 years old. She learnt to speak Dutch, an unusual accomplishment for Javanese women at the time. <br /><br />Kartini continued to educate herself on her own. Because she could speak Dutch, she acquired several Dutch pen friends. One of them, a girl by the name of Rosa Abendanon, became a close friend. Books, newspapers and European magazines fed Kartini's interest in European feminist thinking, and fostered the desire to improve the conditions of indigenous Indonesian women, who at that time had a very low social status.<br /><br />Kartini's concerns were not only in the area of the emancipation of women, but also other problems of her society. Kartini saw that the struggle for women to obtain their freedom, autonomy and legal equality was just part of a wider movement.<br /><br />Her husband understood Kartini's aims and allowed her to establish a school for women in the east porch of the Rembang Regency Office complex. Kartini's only son was born on 13 September 1904. A few days later on 17 September 1904, Kartini died at the age of 25. She was buried in Bulu Village, Rembang.<br /><br />R.A. Kartini argue that not only was she a feminist who elevated the status of women in Indonesia, she was also a nationalist figure, with new ideas, who struggled on behalf of her people and played a role in the national struggle for independence.</p><br />

                        storytelling of snow white<br />A
 long time ago, a child was born to a queen and king and she was called 
Snow White.  When the queen died, the king married again.  This new 
queen was wicked and hated Snow white.  The queen gave orders that Snow 
White was to be treated as a servant.
                                    Snow White grew very beautiful and one day a Prince riding by, saw her at work and fell in love with her.
                                    The
 queen was beautiful too, and every day she asked her Magic Mirror, "Who
 is the fairest in the land?" and the mirror always answered, "You are 
the fairest one of all".
                                    But
 one day the mirror answered Snow White was the fairest in the land, and
 in a rage the queen gave orders to one of her Huntsmen to take Snow 
White into the woods and kill her.
                                    The
 Huntsman had a kind heart and couldn't do the deed so told her to run 
away.  She fled into the woods where Seven little dwarfs lived.  Their 
house was small and strange.
                                     
                                
                                
                                    
                                    Snow
 White entered the little house and finding it very untidy, started to 
clean up.  Upstairs she found seven little beds.  She was very tired and
 stretching out on one of the beds, was soon asleep.
                                    When
 the Dwarfs came home they were surprised to find Snow White and after 
some argument, decided to let her stay.  She promised to cook and look 
after them.
                                    The
 Queen discovered where Snow White was living and disguising herself as a
 witch, took a poisoned apple and set out for the Dwarfs cottage.  She 
gave Snow White the poisoned apple to eat and as soon as she bit the 
apple, she sank into unconsciousness.
                                    Thinking
 she was dead, the Dwarfs built a glass coffin and put her in it. For 
days she lay in the forest in her glass coffin.  One day, the Prince was
 riding through the forest looking for Snow White and found her.  He 
leaned over and kissed her.  She opened her eyes and sat up with a 
smile. Everyone was happy.  The Prince took Snow White to his palace 
where they were married and lived happily ever after.<br /><br />

                        Tuanku Imam Bonjol was borned in Bonjol, Pasaman,Indonesia in 1772<br />He thendied in Manado, Sulawesi in November 6th 1864, in the age of 92 years old and was buried in Khusus Lotak, Minahasa<br />Tuanku Imam Bonjol is not from Minahasa, He was from West Sumatera. “Tuanku Imam Bonjol” is a little given to religious teachers in Sumatra. The real name of Imam Bonjol is Peto Syarif Ibnu Pandito Bayanuddin.<br />He is a well known religious leader in islamic teachings in Sumatera, who used to be against gambling, chicken fight, misuses of dadah, alcoholic drinks, and tobacco, but then moved on to be against the occupancy of the Dutch who had the motto Gold, Glory, Gospel which then caused the Padri war (1821-1837).<br />He first started to learn religion from his father, Buya Nudin. Then he studied from a few teachers like Tuanku Nan Renceh. Imam Bonjol is a leader from the land of Bonjol.<br />The clash between the traditional society and the Padri society, which means the religious society, has made Imam Bonjol take part in it. The Padri society tried to clean the Islamic teachings that were thought to be way too far from its roots, and return it to the pure Islamic path.<br />The traditional society, who was afraid that its existence being wiped out by the religious society, got help from the Dutch army. However, the movement of Imam Bonjol’s troops endangered the Dutch, which forced them to sign a peace treaty with Imam Bonjol in 1824. The treaty was named “Masang Treaty”. Then the Dutch broke the treaty by attacking the land of Pandai Sikat.<br />The next battles had little influence because at the time, the Dutch had to collect strength for the Diponegoro war. After the Diponegoro War, the Dutch used all their troops to take over West Sumatera.<br />Imam Bonjol and his troops were not going to surrender, and with all their might defended themselves. However, with the great strength of the Dutch troops, Imam Bonjol’s land was taken over one by one. After three months, Bonjol was fought and taken back. This happened in 1832.<br />The Dutch used their great troop again. General Governor Van den Bosch lead the attack to Bonjol, but he failed. He then offered a deal called the Palakat Panjang deal, but Imam Bonjol was suspicious about Van den Bosch’s will.<br />For a few periods after that, Tuanku Imam Bonjol had a hard time, but he still insisted to reject peace. The Dutch has changed its general to conquer Bonjol, the little land with a fortress made of clay. After three years of attacks, finally the Dutch occupied Bonjol on August 16th 1837<br />In 1837, the village of Imam Bonjol Berjaya was taken over by the dutch, and Imam Bonjol surrendered. He was then secluded to a lot of places, including Minahasa as the last place. He was titled National Hero.<br />A monument with Sumatera characteristics covered Imam Bonjol’s grave. A carving of Imam Bonjol in the Padri War was carved on one of the sides of the monument. Next to the monument lies the home of Imam Bonjol where he lived through out the time of his seclusion.<br />.<br />.<br />Mau nanya² PR atau Tugas Gratis?<br />WA : 085741074856<br />IG.  : @zeddmnchrs_<br />

As many other Muslim organisations, NU has been struggling in to deal with globalization issues, along with its challenges, opportunities, and threats. Initiatives and eorts have been initiated by NU leaders to avoid negative impacts of globalisation for the society. In this regards, NU leaders with their discourse of Islam Nusantara are known for their thoughts and approach in maintaining religious harmony, not only among Muslims but also for Indonesian society in general. e Research focuses on three research questions; rstly, what is the main idea behind the discourse of Islam Nusantara?; secondly, what are the approach employed by NU leaders to promote the discourse of Islam Nusantara?; and, thirdly, to what extent the discourse of Islam Nusantara has signicance in the context of society’s respond towards globalization? e data collected through literature and documentary study, focusing on primary sources related NU and the discourse of Islam Nusantara. e research found that the idea of Islam Nusantara is an eort to re-establish the contemporary thought of Islam in Indonesia, which allows a process of dialogue between new ideas and thoughts and what have been preserved as heritage from the past. In more specic way, the new idea of Islam Nusantara is basically an eort to interpret the big idea of Pribumisasi Islam, rstly introduced by Abdurrahman Wahid, one of the most prominent NU leaders, in 1980s. e discourse of Islam Nusantara has been actively promoted by NU through its branches in the country as well as its linkages of the prominent gures and scholars. It appears that the discourse of Islam Nusantara is proven to be one of the most prominent contemporary thoughts in Indonesia as they relate to indigenous Islam in Indonesia.

                        <br /><br />The Youth Pledge is a major milestone in the history of the Indonesian independence movement. This pledge was considered as a crystallization of enthusiasm to affirm the ideals of the establishment of the Indonesian state.<br /><br />What is meant by "Youth Pledge" is the decision of the Second Youth Congress held two days, October 27-28, 1928 in Batavia (Jakarta). This decree affirms that there will be "Indonesian homeland", "Indonesian nation" and "Indonesian language". This decision is also expected to be the principle for every "Indonesian national association" and so that "it is broadcast in all newspapers and read in front of meetings".<br /><br />The term "Youth Pledge" itself does not appear in the decision of the congress, but is given afterwards.

                        One fine evening a young princess put on her bonnet and clogs, and went out to take a walk by herself in a wood; and when she came to a cool spring of water with a rose in the middle of it, she sat herself down to rest a while. Now she had a golden ball in her hand, which was her favourite plaything; and she was always tossing it up into the air, and catching it again as it fell.After a time she threw it up so high that she missed catching it as it fell; and the ball bounded away, and rolled along on the ground, until at last it fell down into the spring. The princess looked into the spring after her ball, but it was very deep, so deep that she could not see the bottom of it. She began to cry, and said, 'Alas! if I could only get my ball again, I would give all my fine clothes and jewels, and everything that I have in the world.'Whilst she was speaking, a frog put its head out of the water, and said, 'Princess, why do you weep so bitterly?''Alas!' said she, 'what can you do for me, you nasty frog?

Storytelling Pendek The Lonely Landy

One day, there was a porcupine named Landy. He was lonely. No one wanted
 to play with him, because they were afraid of his spike.

<br />

“Dear Landy. We don’t want to play with you because your spikes are too 
sharp. We don’t want you to hurts us,” said Cici the rabbit one day.

<br />

“Cici is right, Landy. It is not because you’re bad or rude to us, no, 
Landy. Just because of your spikes. They will stab us if we close to 
you,” said Tito the rooster.

<br />

Landy felt lonely. Landy spent most of the time day dreaming at the 
river bank, “I would be happy if there were no spikes on my body.”

<br />

Suddenly, Kuku the turtle appeared from the river. He came to Landy and said, “Landy, what are you thinking of?”

<br />

“Oh, nothing,” Landy replied.

<br />

“Don’t lie to me, Landy! Who knows I can help you,” said Kuku wisely. 
Then he sat beside Landy. He wasn’t afraid of Landy’s spikes.

<br />

Shortly, Landy told his problem. Kuku nodded his head. He said, “Poor 
you. But it isn’t your fault. I know, your spikes are very useful and 
helpful for you. They will realize it someday. Trust me!”

<br />

“Thanks, Kuku. You are my best friend.”

<br />

One day, Koko the frog held his birthday party. He invited all his 
friends, including Landy. But he decided not to come. He didn’t want to 
mess up the party.

<br />

“I’ll come with you Landy. I’ll tell everyone that you’re harmless,” 
said Kuku. Finally Landy attended the party. Everyone enjoyed it.

<br />

Suddenly Tito screamed, “Help….help.…! The evil wolf is coming. Save 
yourself!” Then, everyone saved their lives, except Kuku and landy. Kuku
 pulled his head and his leg into his shell. And Landy rolled his body 
into a ball.

<br />

Unintentionally, the evil wolf touched Landy. Of course, the spike 
pricked him. He screamed, “Ouch!” Since his foot was bleeding, he didn’t
 chase Landy’s friends any longer. Then, he ran away.

<br />

“Horray….horray….! Long live Landy! He saved our lives,” said Cici and 
her friends. They thanked him from then on. Landy wasn’t lonely anymore.<br /><br /><br />semoga membantu :)<br />

                        Farmer and His Three Sons<br /><br />A farmer had three sons. They were all strong and young, but they never agreed with one another. They often quarreled among themselves. The farmer had given them a lot of advice, but they always turned a deaf ear. They disliked advice. The farmer felt very sad about it.<br /><br />The farmer was thinking hard and then he got a good idea. He called all of his sons and ordered them, “Bring me a few sticks.” Then, the farmer tied the sticks into a bundle.<br /><br />“Each of you, break this bundle of sticks said!” said the farmer to his sons. They did what their father said, but they could not break it. Then, the farmer untied the sticks and gave each of his sons a stick. Each of them broke the stick easily in the glance of an eye.<br /><br />“There you are, my sons!”, said the farmer. “If you remain united, you are strong. But if you quarrel with one another, you will be broken one by one easily. Do you understand what I mean?”<br /><br />At last, the advice worked out. They lived in harmony and united ever after. The farmer felt relieved. “Now I can die peacefully,” he whispered.<br /><br />Hello Friend, I Want To Tell You How To Install Aplication<br /> First: turn on your phone<br /> Second: open play store<br /> Third: search the aplication you want<br /> Fourth: klik install to install the aplication<br /> Finally: open the aplication<br />

                        The first President of the Republic of Indonesia, Soekarno, who was usually called Bung Karno, was born in Blitar, East Java, June 6, 1901 and died in Jakarta, June 21, 1970. His father was named Raden Soekemi Sosrodihardjo and his mother Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai. During his life, he had three wives and was blessed with eight children. From Fatmawati's wife, Guntur, Megawati, Rachmawati, Sukmawati and Guruh have children. From his wife Hartini has Taufan and Bayu, while from the wife of Ratna Sari Dewi, a Japanese descendant whose real name is Naoko Nemoto has Kartika's child ...<br /><br />Soekarno's childhood was only a few years living with his parents in Blitar. During elementary school until graduation, he lived in Surabaya, boarding house in the house of Haji Oemar Said Tokroaminoto, veteran politician founder of Syarikat Islam. Then go to school at HBS (Hoogere Burger School). While studying at HBS, Soekarno had galvanized his nationalistic spirit. After graduating from HBS in 1920, he moved to Bandung and continued to THS (Technische Hoogeschool or High Engineering School which is now an ITB). He won the title "Ir" on May 25, 1926.<br /><br />Later, he formulated the Marhaenism teaching and founded PNI (Indonesian National Party) on July 4, 1927, with the aim of an Independent Indonesia. As a result, the Dutch included him in Sukamiskin prison, Bandung on December 29, 1929. Eight months later he was tried. In his defense entitled Indonesia Menggugat, he showed the apostasy of the Dutch, a nation that claimed to be more advanced.<br /><br />His defense made the Dutch even more angry. So that in July 1930, PNI was dissolved. After being released in 1931, Soekarno joined Partindo and at the same time led him. As a result, he was arrested again by the Dutch and exiled to Ende, Flores, in 1933. Four years later he was transferred to Bengkulu.<br /><br />After a long struggle, Bung Karno and Bung Hatta proclaimed the independence of the Republic of Indonesia on August 17, 1945. In the BPUPKI session on June 1, 1945, Ir.Soekarno proposed an idea about the basis of the state which he called Pancasila. On August 17, 1945, Ir Soekarno and Drs. Mohammad Hatta proclaimed Indonesian independence. In the PPKI session, August 18, 1945, Ir. Bloekarno was elected by acclamation as the first President of the Republic of Indonesia.<br /><br />Previously, he also succeeded in formulating the Pancasila which later became the basis (ideology) of the Unitary State of the Republic of Indonesia. He tried to unite the archipelago. Even Soekarno tried to gather nations in Asia, Africa, and Latin America with the Asian-African Conference in Bandung in 1955 which later developed into a Non-Aligned Movement.<br /><br />The G30-S / PKI rebellion gave birth to a great political crisis which caused the MPR's rejection of its responsibility. Instead the MPR appointed Suharto as Acting President. His health continued to deteriorate, which on Sunday, June 21, 1970 he died at the RSPAD. He was buried in Wisma Yaso, Jakarta and buried in Blitar, East Java near the tomb of his mother, Ida Ayu Nyoman Rai. The government conferred it as "The Proclamation Hero<br /><br /><br /><br /><br />

                        Assalamu’alaikum Wr.Wb.<br />Firstly, I would like to say thank you very much for the MC and juries who have given me<br />opportunity to deliver this English speech.<br />Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />It is a great honor for me to stand here and give a brief speech entitled “Formal Education<br />in Indonesia”<br />Brothers and Sisters;<br />Education system in our country is divided into two major parts, they are formal and<br />non-formal. A formal education is divided into three levels: primary, secondary and<br />tertiary education. While non-formal education is carried out for the learners who get<br />difficulties to meet the requirements in formal education. An example of non-formal<br />education is PLS (Pendidikan Luar Sekolah). Both formal and non-formal education aim<br />at establishing the education process in our country.Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />As I have stated previously, formal education involves three levels: primary, secondary<br />and tertiary education. Before entering primary or elementary school, children in our<br />country usually have attended kindergarten, or known as Taman Kanak-kanak. But this<br />education is not compulsory for Indonesian citizens, as the aim of this is just to prepare<br />them for primary school.Children ages 7–12 attend primary education at Elementary School or Sekolah Dasar.<br />This level of education is compulsory for all Indonesian citizens. Similar to education<br />systems in the U.S. and Australia, students must study for six years to complete this level.<br />Some schools offer an accelerated learning program, where students who perform well<br />can finish elementary school in five years.<br />The next level is secondary education. After graduating from elementary school, students<br />attend Middle School or Junior High School (Sekolah Menengah Pertama) for three years<br />from the age of 13-15. After three years of schooling and graduation, students may move<br />on to Senior High School. In Indonesia, this school is basically divided into two kinds:<br />SMA (Sekolah Menengah Atas) and SMK (Sekolah Menengah Kejuruan). SMA is<br />different with SMK in their studies. The students at SMA are prepared to advance to<br />tertiary education or university, while students of SMK as a vocational school are<br />prepared to be ready to work after finishing their school without going to<br />university/college.<br />The last level of education in our country is tertiary education. Students who have<br />graduated from senior high school may attend to university or academy. They can choose<br />any kinds of university or academy based on their interests or scopes of knowledge, for<br />example majoring in English, Mathematics, or teacher training university.Ladies and Gentlemen;<br />Brothers and Sisters;<br />I think that’s all my speech. I hope my brief description on the formal education in our<br />country will be useful for us.<br />Finally, I would like to say sorry if there are mistakes in my speech words.<br />Thank you very much for your attention.<br /><br />Never Surrender To School<br />       Danu is the son of the less fortunate, his mother died at the age of 2 years Danu.

                        <p>Once upon a time in the country of Japan there lived two frogs, one of whom made his home in a ditch near the town of Osaka, on the sea coast, while the other dwelt in a clear little stream which ran through the city of Kioto. At such a great distance apart, they had never even heard of each other; but, funnily enough, the idea came into both their heads at once that they should like to see a little of the world, and the frog who lived at Kioto wanted to visit Osaka, and the frog who lived at Osaka wished to go to Kioto, where the great Mikado had his palace.</p><p>So one fine morning in the spring they both set out along the road that led from Kioto to Osaka, one from one end and the other from the other. The journey was more tiring than they expected, for they did not know much about travelling, and half way between the two towns there arose a mountain which had to be climbed. It took them a long time and a great many hops to reach the top, but there they were at last, and what was the surprise of each to see another frog before him! They looked at each other for a moment without speaking, and then fell into conversation, explaining the cause of their meeting so far from their homes. It was delightful to find that they both felt the same wish--to learn a little more of their native country--and as there was no sort of hurry they stretched themselves out in a cool, damp place, and agreed that they would have a good rest before they parted to go their ways.</p><p>'What a pity we are not bigger,' said the Osaka frog; 'for then we could see both towns from here, and tell if it is worth our while going on.'</p><p>'Oh, that is easily managed,' returned the Kioto frog. 'We have only got to stand up on our hind legs, and hold on to each other, and then we can each look at the town he is travelling to.'</p><p>This idea pleased the Osaka frog so much that he at once jumped up and put his front paws on the shoulders of his friend, who had risen also. There they both stood, stretching themselves as high as they could, and holding each other tightly, so that they might not fall down. The Kioto frog turned his nose towards Osaka, and the Osaka frog turned his nose towards Kioto; but the foolish things forgot that when they stood up their great eyes lay in the backs of their heads, and that though their noses might point to the places to which they wanted to go their eyes beheld the places from which they had come.</p><p>'Dear me!' cried the Osaka frog, 'Kioto is exactly like Osaka. It is certainly not worth such a long journey. I shall go home!'</p><p>'If I had had any idea that Osaka was only a copy of Kioto I should never have travelled all this way,' exclaimed the frog from Kioto, and as he spoke he took his hands from his friend's shoulders, and they both fell down on the grass. Then they took a polite farewell of each other, and set off for home again, and to the end of their lives they believed that Osaka and Kioto, which are as different to look at as two towns can be, were as like as two peas.</p>two men were walking along one summer day. soon it became too hot to continue and on seeing a large pain tree nearrby, they threw themselves on the ground to rest in its shade. gazing up into the branches one man said to the other, "what a useless tree! it does not have fruit or nuts that we can eat and we cannot een use its wood for camping." the tree rustled in reply, "don't be so ungrateful. i am being extremely useful to you at this very moment, shielding you from the hot sun. you call me a good-for-nothing!"<br />

She ran away into the woods. She was very tired and hungry.<br /><br />    Then, she saw this little cottage. She knocked but no one answered so she went inside and fell asleep. Meanwhile, the seven dwarfs were coming home from work. They went inside. There they found Snow White sleeping. Then, Snow White woke up. She saw the dwarfs. The dwarfs said,”What is your name?” Snow White said, “My name is Snow White”.<br /><br />    The dwarfs said, “If you wish , you may live here with us”. Snow White said, “Oh,could I? Thank you”.

                        <p>Topic : Environment<br />Script : Ahmad Manan<br />Grade : SMP/SMA/University</p><p>Assalamu ‘alaikum wr. Wb<br />Good Afternoon,</p><p>Honorable all the juries and the committee of this English speech contest.<br />First of all, let’s thank to Allah SWT who has given us many mercies and blessing so we<br />can join this program without any troubles. Secondly, I would like to introduce myself.<br />My name is ……. I am a student of …..</p><p>Well, ladies and gentlemen, in this occasion I would like to tell you about environment.<br />Environment is everything around us. Environment consists of two main parts which are<br />biotic and a biotic environment. Biotic environment is everything around us which are<br />live, for example plants, animals and human beings. While a biotic environment is<br />everything around us which are not live, for example stone, water, wind, land and etc.<br />We must protect our environment as good as possible because it can influence our live.<br />As we know that Indonesia has many tropical forests and it is a source of nature which<br />can help people live peacefully. So as human being we should preserve the forest.</p><p>There are some efforts which should be done by all people:<br />1. Not cutting down the trees in the forest<br />2. Planting any kinds of trees in the barren area of the forest</p><p>Cutting down the trees in the forest can cause many disasters for human beings. Of<br />course it can cause flood because the rain water can’t be absorbed by the root of plants so<br />the water flows directly to the ground. There are many damage caused by the flood,<br />many people being homeless because of flood, the flood kill many kinds of pet, many<br />factories can’t produce anything, transportation can’t run well because the bridge is<br />broken and so on. How horrified the flood is…!!</p><p>Actually, the disasters above can be minimized if all of human beings can preserve our<br />environment and we must pay more attention to the environment whenever and<br />wherever. We must not throw away rubbish anywhere which can disturb the flowing of<br />the river water. We should plant any kinds of trees in the barren area or in side of the<br />road.</p><p>By doing those simple efforts, it means we have participated in the preservation of our<br />environment.<br />I think that’s all and thank you very much for your attention.<br />Wassalamu ‘alaikum wr. Wb</p><p><br /></p><p>^^</p><br />

                            39. story telling kabayan</h2><br />
                        Kabayan and the arrogant king<br /><br />Long, long ago, in west java, there lived a plain man, named kabayan. Kabayan was not really smart, but he had so many unpredictable ideas to solve the problems in his village.<br />One day, when kabayan was sitting and drinking enjoyably on his lovely chair, his best friend, ujang called kabayan, "kabayan!"<br />Kabayan was schocked, "astagfirullah haladzim"!<br />"This is ujang, are you there?"<br />"I am. You can come in"<br />When ujang was in kabayan's house, he got confused seeing kabayan's clothe wet<br />"Kabayan, why are you wet?"<br />"Elek elek, ujang I got shocked when u called me loudly"<br />"Forgive me, kabayan"<br />"He-eh"<br />Suddenly, ujang was so serious. "Kabayan, u know the king who lives in that kingdom?"<br />Kabayan said, "yes I  know, why?"<br />"What do u think of him?"<br />Kabayan thought about it seriously, "um.. king in the kindom... i dont know"<br />"Kabayan, that king is so arrogant, soo unfair and also doesnt really care about his people".<br />Kabayan thought again, "so?"<br />"So! I want u to talk to him!"<br />Kabayan didint understand what ujang was talking about, he said, "talk about what?"<br />"You talk to him to change his character and care of his people"<br />"I'll do it!" Kabayan said<br /><br />In the next day, kabayan went to the kingdom to talk to the king. When he met the king, he said, "o my king! Your people told me that u are not fair to ur people"<br />Then, the king got angry to kabayan "how dare you saying that!!! You will be killed by my guard! Guards!<br />Kabayan was panic! He said, "my king how pity you are. Dont u see? There are a lot of your people die! Why ? Because the have nothing to eat."<br />The king got angier and snap at kabayan, "shut up! Shut your mouth! You are out of your limit!"<br />Kabayan said, "My king, please stop it. Your people respect you because they believe, one day their lovely king, will change his mind. And care about them?<br />The king thought about it deeply, then he said, "do they?"<br />"Yes, my king"<br />"Kabayan, forgive me, all I have done is wrong"<br />After that, kabayan said, "my king, it's not too late to make a change"<br />"You are right, start from now, I promise, i promise to help my people and reedem my mistakes".<br />Started from that, the king got wiser and cared way more about his people -THE END-<br /><br />Diposting 18th November 2016 oleh Indah Pujayanti<br /><br /><br />
