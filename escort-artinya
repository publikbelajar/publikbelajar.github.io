                                            SOAL UJIAN MASUK UM UGM 2013     US pop and soul music legend Stevie Wonder told diplomats from nearly 200 nations on Monday to stop squabbling over copyright and agree on a pact bringing "hope and light" to the blind people around the globe.
And the singer-musician, himself sightless since just after birth, warned negotiators at the United Nation intellectual property and copyright agency WIPO that he would write a sad song about them if they didn't act on his appeal.
“We must declare a state of emergency and end the information deprivation that continues to keep the visually impaired in the dark”, said Wonder, whose music has won dozens of top awards in his 50-year career.
He told delegates on the opening day of WIPO’s annual assembly that they should agree on an action plan that would empower the blind and near-blind by side-stepping copy-right rule and giving them access to books and learning.
And the star wrapped up his 10-minutes appeal by singing to his own accompaniment famous lines from many of his best-loved songs including I Just Called to Say I Love You and Keep Our Love Alive.
His call was endorsed by the World Blind Union, which said that in developing countries less than one percent of published works were available in formats like Braille or audio. Even in rich countries, the total was less than 5 percent.
WIPO member states have for years been considering a deal that would overcome cross-border copy-right rules and finance translation of books into Braille but has run up against strong differences among member states.
Some argue for totally free rights of translation into formats accessible to the blind, while others insists that no loopholes be left for piracy of texts, music, and technology.
Wonder, a UN Messenger of Peace who has sold more than 100 million records since the 1960s, said delegates should “put ideological differences aside and come up with a practical solution”.
While it was critical in loosening laws to avoid harming authors of great works that “nourish our hearts, minds and souls,” he said, WIPO members must find a deal that allowed easy import and export of copyright material for the blind.
“We have the greatest minds in the worlds right here in this room. Please work it out. Pr I’ll have to write a song about what you didn’t do, he declared to laughter and applause from many delegations.

He wrote a book about his travels thatbecame one of the most famous travel guides in history. They called him "the man with amillion stories." Marco Polo was born in 1254 to a family of merchants. His home was Venice,Italy. Venetian merchants bought and sold valuable Chinese goods, including precious silk cloth.Such goods were brought to Europe along an ancient route known as the Silk Road. The merchantsalso used the route to travel east on trading missions. His family taught him to be a merchant. Helearned how to read, write, calculate, and use foreign money.In 1271. Marco's father and uncle, Niccolo and Maffeo set out for China again. Marco, then17 years old, joined his father and uncle for the trip. It took the Polos four difficult years to reachChina. The journey led across deserts and high mountains. They passed through wild countrysidewhere bandits lurked, ready to rob and kill. They braved heat and cold, floods, deep snowdrifts.and blinding sandstorms. At last they reached the summer palace of the Mongol conqueror. KublaiKhan, at Shangdu,The Khan welcomed the Polos warmly. He offered Marco a job. Marco accepted, and thePolos lived in China for the next 17 years. Marco travelled on many special missions across theKhan's kingdom and to distant lands. When Marco returned from his missions, he told the Khanvivid stories about the people and lands he visited. Over time, the Polos worried that Kublai Khanwould not allow them to leave. Several times they had asked the Khan for permission to returnto Europe. But the khan enjoyed his story so much that he would not grant their wish. Finally, theKhan changed his mind. In 1292. Kublai Khan asked Marco to escort a Mongol princess to Persia.The Polos travelled by ship from China to the Persian Gulf. Then the Polos headed for Venice,finally reaching home in 1295.In 1298, he became a prisoner of war. He shared his cell with a writer named Rustichello, whohelped Marco turned his stories into a book. Marco Polo returned to Venice after his release fromprison. He died in 1324. But his book remained popular for centuries. Merchants, mapmakers, andexplorers all looked to the book for information about Asian lands.

                            9. SOAL UJIAN MASUK UM UGM 2013     US pop and soul music legend Stevie Wonder told diplomats from nearly 200 nations on Monday to stop squabbling over copyright and agree on a pact bringing "hope and light" to the blind people around the globe.
And the singer-musician, himself sightless since just after birth, warned negotiators at the United Nation intellectual property and copyright agency WIPO that he would write a sad song about them if they didn't act on his appeal.
“We must declare a state of emergency and end the information deprivation that continues to keep the visually impaired in the dark”, said Wonder, whose music has won dozens of top awards in his 50-year career.
He told delegates on the opening day of WIPO’s annual assembly that they should agree on an action plan that would empower the blind and near-blind by side-stepping copy-right rule and giving them access to books and learning.
And the star wrapped up his 10-minutes appeal by singing to his own accompaniment famous lines from many of his best-loved songs including I Just Called to Say I Love You and Keep Our Love Alive.
His call was endorsed by the World Blind Union, which said that in developing countries less than one percent of published works were available in formats like Braille or audio. Even in rich countries, the total was less than 5 percent.
WIPO member states have for years been considering a deal that would overcome cross-border copy-right rules and finance translation of books into Braille but has run up against strong differences among member states.
Some argue for totally free rights of translation into formats accessible to the blind, while others insists that no loopholes be left for piracy of texts, music, and technology.
Wonder, a UN Messenger of Peace who has sold more than 100 million records since the 1960s, said delegates should “put ideological differences aside and come up with a practical solution”.
While it was critical in loosening laws to avoid harming authors of great works that “nourish our hearts, minds and souls,” he said, WIPO members must find a deal that allowed easy import and export of copyright material for the blind.
“We have the greatest minds in the worlds right here in this room. Please work it out. Pr I’ll have to write a song about what you didn’t do, he declared to laughter and applause from many delegations.

                            18. Exercise1. Do the following tasks!Task 1Read the text and answer the questions!Marco Polo won fame for his journeys across Asia. He wrote a book about his travels thatbecame one of the most famous travel guides in history. They called him "the man with amillion stories." Marco Polo was born in 1254 to a family of merchants. His home was Venice,Italy. Venetian merchants bought and sold valuable Chinese goods, including precious silk cloth.Such goods were brought to Europe along an ancient route known as the Silk Road. The merchantsalso used the route to travel east on trading missions. His family taught him to be a merchant. Helearned how to read, write, calculate, and use foreign money.In 1271. Marco's father and uncle, Niccolo and Maffeo set out for China again. Marco, then17 years old, joined his father and uncle for the trip. It took the Polos four difficult years to reachChina. The journey led across deserts and high mountains. They passed through wild countrysidewhere bandits lurked, ready to rob and kill. They braved heat and cold, floods, deep snowdrifts.and blinding sandstorms. At last they reached the summer palace of the Mongol conqueror. KublaiKhan, at Shangdu,The Khan welcomed the Polos warmly. He offered Marco a job. Marco accepted, and thePolos lived in China for the next 17 years. Marco travelled on many special missions across theKhan's kingdom and to distant lands. When Marco returned from his missions, he told the Khanvivid stories about the people and lands he visited. Over time, the Polos worried that Kublai Khanwould not allow them to leave. Several times they had asked the Khan for permission to returnto Europe. But the khan enjoyed his story so much that he would not grant their wish. Finally, theKhan changed his mind. In 1292. Kublai Khan asked Marco to escort a Mongol princess to Persia.The Polos travelled by ship from China to the Persian Gulf. Then the Polos headed for Venice,finally reaching home in 1295.In 1298, he became a prisoner of war. He shared his cell with a writer named Rustichello, whohelped Marco turned his stories into a book. Marco Polo returned to Venice after his release fromprison. He died in 1324. But his book remained popular for centuries. Merchants, mapmakers, andexplorers all looked to the book for information about Asian lands.

Rafi: Dafi, Bagas, and Malik! You play drones! I mean control drones, in our secret place! Bagas: Yay! Malik: Hooray! Play the game! Dafi: This is not a game! ïMalik: This is a game! The diamond was owned by the government that are stored in a store. The store actually sells home goods but, because of the store that is the most reliable and close to the government palace. But because there is a great thief of theft. Shafira: huh !? The diamond are lost? Aliya: But, it still here this morning! Kintan: the diamond was stolen by a thief that is great. They said, there was a person who saw someone carrying the diamond. The person reported it to the government. I see on that news. Shafira: Oh.. but, how?

                        Suatu hari, ada berita di sebuah kota tentang dicurinya berlian-berlian oleh para pencuri. Beberapa perkumpulan Detektif langsung mencari berlian untuk mendapatkannya kembali. Mereka memiliki 6 hewan detektif yang terdiri dari empat kucing, satu ikan, dan satu kelinci. Mereka selalu membantu detektif dalam setiap misi.<br /><br />Tyo: Kita punya pekerjaaan kan? Apa yang kita lakukan?<br />Bagas: Ya, membosankan<br />Rafi: Tunggu! Ada sebuah kabar. Kita benar2 harus bekerja<br />Keanu: Ha?!! Berlian2nya dicuri!! Buruk! Buruk! Buruk!<br />Andika: Wo, sangat tidak baik<br />Rafi: Ya kan? Aku sudah bilang kan? Kita benar2 harus bekerja<br />Bagas: Ya, aku setuju!!<br />Rafi: Dafi, Bagas, and Malik! Kau mainkan dronenya! Maksudku mengontrol dronenya! Di tempat persembunyian kita<br />Bagas: Yes!<br />Malik: Hore! Mainkan permainannya<br />Dafi: Ini bukanlah permainan<br />Malik: Ini adalah permainan!<br /><br />Berlian itu milik pemerintah yang disimpan di toko. Toko benar-benar menjual barang-barang rumah tetapi, karena toko itu adalah yang paling dapat diandalkan dan dekat dengan istana pemerintah. Namun karena ada pencuri besar yang hebat.<br /><br />Shafira: Ha?! Berlian2 nya hilang?<br />Alia: Tapi tadi pagi masih ada disini!<br />Kintan: Pencuri berlian nya adalah org yang handal. Mereka mengatakan, ada orang yang melihat seseorang membawa berlian2 itu. Orang itu melaporkan ke pemerintah. Aku lihat di beritanya<br />Shafira: Oh.. Tapi bagaimana caranya?<br />Aliya: Ngomong2 dimana Pipy, Nino, Boga, Bogi dan Pucy? <br /><br />Tiba-tiba Anggi, Sasa dan Nadira datang untuk mengawal 5 hewan. Seekor kucing ibu bernama Nino dengan 3 anak kucing, bernama Boga, Bogi, Pucy, dan 1 kelinci bernama Pipy. Anggi, Sasa dan Nadira adalah detektif pengontrol drone<br />Begitu juga dengan Shafira, Aliya dan Kintan. Mereka adalah detektif rahasia. Tapi mereka bertiga bekerja sebagai detektif lainnya.<br /><br />Sasa: ​​Mereka ada disini. Sebelumnya kita melihat mereka berada di jalanan.<br />Nadira: Jadi, kita membawa mereka di sini.<br />Kintan: Terima kasih Anggi, Sasa dan Nadira.<br />Nadira, Anggi dan Sasa: ​​Ya! Tidak masalah! Sama-sama!<br />Anggi: Ngomong2, di mana berlian2nya?<br />Kintan: Berlian itu dicuri oleh pencuri di kota ini.<br />Aliya: Dia benar!<br />Shafira: Mari kita menemukan berlian2 itu dan bekerja sama dengan detektif lain! Setuju?<br />Gadis: Setuju!!<br /><br />Mereka mencari berlian. Dan mereka dengan detektif lainnya.<br />Malik: Heh .. Aku yang mengendalikan pesawatnya!<br />Nadira: Kami juga mengontrolnya.<br />Anggi: Hanya kamu yang mengendalikannya?<br />Sasa: ​​Kami juga!<br />Dafi: Cukup! Jangan ribut-ribut, kita mengontrolnya bersama sekarang.<br />Bagas: Dan kalian juga akan menemukan pekerjaan masing2! Bersiaplah!<br /><br />Para detektif mulai menjalankan misinya. Hewan-hewan membantu para detektif. Berlian itu tampaknya telah dicuri dan disimpan di menara tua. Drone yang dikendalikan oleh Malik telah menemukan lokasi berlian. Para detektif mencoba untuk mendapatkannya kembali. kucing Nino dan kelinci Pipy mengalihkan perhatian anjing dan elang menjaga bangunan tua. Kintan mengalihkan perhatian penjaga di menara pada pesawat pribadi. Ada seseorang yang mengatakan Shafira dan Aliya tentang penjaga yang menjaga berlian. Nino dan kelinci Pipy bersama Shafira dan Aliya menyusup. Begitu juga dengan Rafi, Tyo, Andika dan Keanu dengan detektif ikan bernama Fildo. Tyo bersama Pucy, Boga dan Bogi menemukan berlian dan diserahkan kepada Rafi. Ketika dibawa ke tempat rahasia, Bogi mencium sesuatu. Bogi memakannya.<br /><br />Tyo: Teman2... itu adalah kue<br /><br />Rupanya, berlian itu palsu terbuat dari kue di pewarna makanan berlian untuk warna berlian palsu.<br />Rafi: Aaa! Ini palsu!<br />Dafi: Apa yang harus kita lakukan sekarang ?!<br />Bagas: Tapi berlian itu berharga! Kita harus mendapatkannya kembali!<br />Rafi: Jadi, apa yang kita tunggu?<br />Tyo: Mari kita kembali!<br /><br />Para detektif berusaha untuk mendapatkannya kembali. Akhirnya mereka menemukan berlian2 itu.<br />Rafi: Ya! Kami mendapatkan berliannya kembali!<br />Andika: Dan sekarang kita akan ....<br /><br />Tapi, tiba-tiba, pencuri akan datang.<br />Andika: Oh .. tidak.<br />Rafi: Kamu..?<br />Pencuri: Hey! Kembalikan berlian saya sekarang !!<br />Tiba-tiba, ada suara mobil polisi datang.<br />Keanu: Kita sangat beruntung!<br />Pencuri: TIDAK..<br />Polisi: Anda tertangkap! Anda mencuri barang berharga dari pemerintah!<br /><br />Pencuri telah ditangkap oleh polisi. Kota ini menjadi aman dan damai.<br /><br />Semoga membantu :)<br />
