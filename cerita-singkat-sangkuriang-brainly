                        The Story of Sangkuriang<br /><br />In ancient times, in West Java there lived a princess called Dayang Sumbi. She had a son named Sangkuriang. The kid was very fond of hunting in the forest. He was always accompanied by a pet dog named Tumang when he went for hunting. Tumang was actually an incarnation of God, and was also the real father of Sangkuriang, but Sangkuriang did not know it and his mother was deliberately kept it a secret.<br /><br />One day, as usual Sangkuriang went to the forest for hunting. After arriving in the forest, Sangkuriang began to look for game. He saw a bird perched on a branch, then without a second thought Sangkuriang immediately shot on target. Sangkuriang then ordered Tumang to chase his quarry earlier, but the Tumang kept silent and did not want to follow the order of Sangkuriang. He was very annoyed. Then he expelled Tumang and did not allowed him to go home again.<br /><br />Arriving at home, Sangkuriang told the incident to his mother. Upon hearing the story of his son, Dayang Sumbi was very angry. She picked up a spoon of rice, and banged on Sangkuriang’s head. Disappointed with his mother’s treatment, Sangkuriang decided to go wandering, and left his home.<br /><br />After the incident, Dayang Sumbi regretted her actions. She prayed daily, and asked that one day she was able to meet her son again. Because of the sincerity of Dayang Sumbi’s prayer, then God gave her a gift of eternal beauty and young age forever.<br /><br />After Sangkuriang was wandering for several years, he finally intended to return to his hometown. Once he was there, he was very surprised because his hometown had changed completely. Sangkuriang’s happiness increased when he met a very beautiful woman, Dayang Sumbi. Fascinated by the beauty of the woman, Sangkuriang immediately proposed her. Finally Sangkuriang proposal was accepted by Dayang Sumbi, and she agreed to be married in the near future.<br /><br />One day, Sangkuriang asked permission of his wife to hunt in the forest. Before leaving, he asked Dayang Sumbi to tighten and to tidy up his boat. Dayang Sumbi was surprised because when she loosened the headband Sangkuriang, she saw a scar. That scar seemed like his son’s. After asking Sangkuriang about the cause of the wound, Dayang Sumbi’s surprised grew increasingly because it was true that her husband was her own child.<br />Dayang Sumbi was very confused, because it was impossible to marry her own son. After Sangkuriang came home from hunting, Dayang Sumbi tried to talk to Sangkuriang, so Sangkuriang canceled their wedding plans. Dayang Sumbi’s request was not approved by Sangkuriang.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi thought how to make their marriage never happen. After thinking hard, finally Dayang Sumbi found the best way. She proposed two conditions to Sangkuriang. If Sangkuriang could meet both these conditions, then Dayang Sumbi wanted to be his wife, but otherwise if it failed then the wedding would be canceled. The first condition was she wanted the Citarum River to be dammed. And the second was she asked Sangkuriang to make a very big boat to cross the river. The second condition must be finished before dawn.<br /><br />Sangkuriang undertook both Dayang Sumbi’s requests, and promised to finish it before dawn. With his supernatural powers, Sangkuriang then mobilized his friends from the jinn to help him complete the task. Secretly, Dayang Sumbi peeked the work of Sangkuriang. How surprised she was. Sangkuriang almost finished all the conditions given by Dayang Sumbi before dawn.<br /><br />Dayang Sumbi then asked her neighbors for a red silk cloth in the east of the city. When she saw the color of red in the east of the city, Sangkuriang thought that the day was early morning. Sangkuriang immediately stopped his job and felt unable to meet the requirements proposed by Dayang Sumbi.<br /><br />With a sense of annoyance and disappointment, Sangkuriang then break through the dam that he had made himself. Because the dam collapsed, there was flooding and the whole city was inundated. Sangkuriang also kicked the big boat he had made. The canoe floated and fell facedown, then into a mountain called Tangkuban Perahu.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Their son is named Sangkuriang. He was very smart and handsome like his father. Everyday, he hunted animals and looked for fruits to eat. One day, when he was hunting, Sangkuriang accidentally killed Tumang. His arrow missed the deer he was targeting and hit Tumang instead. He went home and tells her mother about the dog. “What?” Dayang Sumbi was appalled. Driven by sadness and anger, she grabbed a weaving tool and hit Sangkuriang’s head with it.

She fell asleep, and in her dream, she meets her husband. “Dayang Sumbi, don’t be sad. Go look for my body in the woods and get the heart. Soak it with water, and use the water to bathe, and you will look young forever,” said the prince in her dream. After bathing with the water used to soak the dog’s heart, Dayang Sumbi looked more beautiful and even younger.</p><p></p><p>And time passed by. Sangkuriang on his journey stopped at a village and met and fell in love with a beautiful girl.He didn’t realize that the village was his homeland and the beautiful girl was his own mother, Dayang Sumbi. Their love grew naturally and he asked the girl to marry him. One day, Sangkuriang was going on a hunt. He asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the turban on his head.

Despite a Dog, Tumang actually an incarnation of the god and the father of Sangkuriang.One day, he got mad at Tumang for not pursuing the animals. Because of so angry, he then expelled Tumang so the dog went into the woods.He then returned to the palace and told the incident to her mother. Dayang Sumbi was so angry and hit his head. Sangkuriang then disappointed and he decided to wander.After hitting Sangkuriang, Dayang Sumbi felt so sorry and she always prayed and meditated to get forgiveness from God. One day, God gave a gift because she was so diligent in praying. The prize is a timeless beauty that would make Sumbi Dayang becoming young forever.After wandering for a dozen years, Sangkuriang returned home. When he reached the kingdom, all had changed. He did not know what was happening. One day, he met a girl who was so beautiful. The girl was actually a Sumbi Dayang, his own mother.Sangkurian fell in love with the girl and then proposed her. Because of the handsomeness that was owned by Sangkuriang, then Dayang Sumbi also fell in love. One day, Sangkuriang want to hunt and he asked Dayang Sumbi to fix the headband. However, Dayang Sumbi surprised that her future husband had a head injury. Dayang Sumbi then realized that was the same injury as her son who wandered away. She then noticed Sangkuriang face, and she was more surprised to realize that her husband was Sangkuriang, her own son.After those happenings, she immediately looked for ways to thwart the plan of making a proposal. She then proposed two requirements to Sangkuriang. First, Sangkuriang should stem the Citarum River. Secondly, she asked Sangkuriang to make a big canoe to cross the river. Both of those conditions should be finished before sunrise.At night, Sangkuriang asked for help to spirit creatures to complete all the work. Dayang Sumbi secretly peeked at the job. Once the work was almost complete, Dayang Sumbi ordered his forces to hold a very long red carpet to the east of the city.The carpet made ​​the light became red and Sangkuriang thought that the sun had risen. He stopped his work and was very upset because all could not meet the requirements posed by Dayang Sumbi. Using his strength, Sangkuriang broke the dam and the city became flooding. His big canoe then crashed upside down and changed into a mountain named, Tangkuban Perahu.<br />
