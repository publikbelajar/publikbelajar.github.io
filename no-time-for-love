                                            Number One For Me | Maher Zain
I was a foolish little child
Crazy things I used to do
And all the pain I put you through
Mama now Im here for you
For all the times I made you cry
The days I told you lies
Now its time for you to rise
For all the things you sacrificed
(2x)
Oooh
If I could turn back time rewind
If I could make it undone I swear that I would
I would make it up to you
Mom Im all grown up now
It's a brand new day
Id like to put a smile on your face everyday
Mom Im all grown up now
And its not too late
Id like to put a smile on your face everyday
You know you are the number one for me (3x)
Oh oh
Number one for me
Now I finally understand
Your famous line
About the day Id face in time
Coz now I have a child of mine
Even though I was so bad
Ive learnt so much from you
Now Im trying to do it too
Love my kids the way you do
There is no one in this world
That can take your place
Oooh Im sorry for ever taken you for granted
I will use every chance I get
To make you smile
Whenever Im around you
Now I will to try to love you
Like you love me
Only God knows how much you mean to me

                                            the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </a>

Mamma
You gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
And mamma
All you had to offer
Was the promise of a lifetime of love
Now I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And I know
A love so complete
Someday must leave
Must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
Mamma
You gave love to me
Turned a young one into a woman
And mamma
All I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you loving me
'Cause I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And it hurts so
That something so strong
Someday will be gone, must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
But the love you give will always live
You'll always be there every time I fall
You are to me the greatest love of all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love you 'till forever comes
And when you need me
I'll be there for you all the way
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I promise you, mamma
I'll your beacon through the darkest nights
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you 'till forever comes
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
'Till we meet again
Until then
Goodbye</a>

                            16. the story tells us about?Once upon a time, in an island there lived all the feelings and emotions : Happiness, Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day it was announced to them that the island would sink! So all constructed boats and left. Except for Love.  Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment.  When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help.  Richness was passing by Love in a boat. Love said,  "Richness, can you take me with you?" Richness answered, "Sorry Love, I can't. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat and so there is no place here for you."  Love next asked Vanity who was also sailing by. Vanity was also ready with the same answer.   "I can't help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered.  Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, take me along with you." "Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!", sadness said in a sullen voice.  Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so preoccupied with her happiness that she did not even hear when Love called her.   Suddenly, there was a voice, "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. An overjoyed Love jumped up into the boat and in the process forgot to ask where they were going. When they arrived at a dry land, the elder went her own way.   Realizing how much was owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge another elder, "Who Helped me?" "It was Time," Knowledge answered. "Time?" thought Love. Then, as if reading the face of Love, Knowledge smiled and answered, "Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is." </h2><br />

Lagunya
Mamma
You gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
And mamma
All you had to offer
Was the promise of a lifetime of love
Now I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And I know
A love so complete
Someday must leave
Must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
Mamma
You gave love to me
Turned a young one into a woman
And mamma
All I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you loving me
'Cause I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And it hurts so
That something so strong
Someday will be gone, must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
But the love you give will always live
You'll always be there every time I fall
You are to me the greatest love of all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love you 'till forever comes
And when you need me
I'll be there for you all the way
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I promise you, mamma
I'll your beacon through the darkest nights
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm

Mamma
You gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
And mamma
All you had to offer
Was the promise of a lifetime of love
Now I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And I know
A love so complete
Someday must leave
Must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
Mamma
You gave love to me
Turned a young one into a woman
And mamma
All I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you loving me
'Cause I know
There is no other
Love like a mother's love for her child
And it hurts so
That something so strong
Someday will be gone, must say goodbye
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
But the love you give will always live
You'll always be there every time I fall
You are to me the greatest love of all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love you 'till forever comes
And when you need me
I'll be there for you all the way
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I promise you, mamma
I'll your beacon through the darkest nights
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you 'till forever comes
Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
'Till we meet again
Until then
Goodbye</h2><br />
