Seven people were killed in a collision between a bus, a car and a truck at 10:35 p.m. on Jalan Sultan last night. The dead were all passengers in the car. Police believe the car may have been trying to overtake the bus when it was struck by a truck coming from the opposite direction. The driver of the car may not have been using his lights, as the truck driver said he did not see the car approaching. The police said the car should not have been trying to pass the bus, since overtaking is not allowed on Jalan Sultan. In addition, the police reported that the car–a small Japanese car–should not have been carrying more than five people. The names of the victims are not yet known.</a>

South Korean boy group BTS have beaten a record that British singer Adele held for five years, and they did it with a song that has been out for six months.
“Black Swan”, off their latest album “Map of the Soul: 7”, topped the iTunes charts in 104 countries, overtaking Adele’s record of 102 for the 2015 hit ‘Hello’.
This race up the iTunes charts comes at a time when BTS — made up of members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook — have been largely quiet while working on a new album.
So where did this sudden collective push from fans — called ARMY — to secure this record come from? Some joked that this was a result of ARMY being bored and wanting to show their affection for the K-Pop sensation.
Various fan bases on Twitter urged people to buy the single in countries … ‘Black Swan’ had not peaked, which led to the song rising to the top of the iTunes charts in Nepal, Zimbabwe, Cape Verde and Belize. … they had broken a new record, the fans were still not satisfied. They were now trying to make the group have the most liked video on YouTube.
“Map of the Soul: 7”, released on February 21, debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with 422,000 album-equivalent units earned in its first week. It is the highest selling album in South Korean history.

                                            When I was at the road, the rain having been stopped,so we can get out from the car. If the rain hadn’t been stopped, we will get wet , cold and many accidents will happened at the same time. So we need to careful in driving a car, if not we will get an accident and never try to anwer the phone in streets. There may be bad for us and other people. We always have been heard the news about a car that hit the face or a truck that is rolled in the street. The impact is because they aren’t focus with the sigh and take them for granted. As we can see in the television that the driver or passenger already know that sign, but they always violate the sign by turning around and when the police catched them, They always ask what is my mistake? And the police answered did you see the sign that you can’t u-turn here and sometimes their SIM is already finished and they always drive a car without a valid SIM and they also overtaking or cut off the other person road and sometimes also they was in a reckles, the school student who don’t have SIM will remind the parents by not giving them the motorcycle, if the police found the Senior school student riding a motorcycle, they will stopped him, drove them to his hosuse or his friend house and the motorcycle wil arrested by the police, they can get the motorcycle, if the SIM is already with him. Be careful also with the husband who bring his wife and son to a far place, Make sure that you have two helm for you and your child, if you bring you wife and child, didn’t ever race with the people, because their safety is the first one for them. If he already have accident, he will angry to the people who was crashing his car in the street and they didn’t realized the situation, they will fight with each other. Iam worried with the people attitude to the police in the streets. Ini ada berapa garis ya?</a>

South Korean boy group BTS have beaten a record that British singer Adele held for five years, and they did it with a song that has been out for six months.
“Black Swan”, off their latest album “Map of the Soul: 7”, topped the iTunes charts in 104 countries, overtaking Adele’s record of 102 for the 2015 hit ‘Hello’.
This race up the iTunes charts comes at a time when BTS — made up of members RM, Jin, Suga, J-Hope, Jimin, V and Jungkook — have been largely quiet while working on a new album.
So where did this sudden collective push from fans — called ARMY — to secure this record come from? Some joked that this was a result of ARMY being bored and wanting to show their affection for the K-Pop sensation.
Various fan bases on Twitter urged people to buy the single in countries … ‘Black Swan’ had not peaked, which led to the song rising to the top of the iTunes charts in Nepal, Zimbabwe, Cape Verde and Belize. … they had broken a new record, the fans were still not satisfied. They were now trying to make the group have the most liked video on YouTube.
“Map of the Soul: 7”, released on February 21, debuted at number one on the US Billboard 200 chart with 422,000 album-equivalent units earned in its first week. It is the highest selling album in South Korean history.

If the rain hadn’t been stopped, we will get wet , cold and many accidents will happened at the same time. So we need to careful in driving a car, if not we will get an accident and never try to anwer the phone in streets. There may be bad for us and other people.

As we can see in the television that the driver or passenger already know that sign, but they always violate the sign by turning around and when the police catched them, They always ask what is my mistake? And the police answered did you see the sign that you can’t u-turn here and sometimes their SIM is already finished and they always drive a car without a valid SIM and they also overtaking or cut off the other person road and sometimes also they was in a reckles, the school student who don’t have SIM will remind the parents by not giving them the motorcycle, if the police found the Senior school student riding a motorcycle, they will stopped him, drove them to his hosuse or his friend house and the motorcycle wil arrested by the police, they can get the motorcycle, if the SIM is already with him.

In addition, the police reported that the car, a small japanese car, should not have been carying more than five people. If the passanger had brought their identity car cards, the police would have identified the names of the victims easly.
