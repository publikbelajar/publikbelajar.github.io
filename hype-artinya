                                            ROBIN HOOD THE PRINCE OF THIEVESLong time ago, England was ruled by a greedy King. He ordered the Sheriff, to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and his friend, Little John. They would steal the tax money from sheriff and give it back to the poor.One day, the king was traveling. He was so busy counting his gold . He didn’t notice that he was passing through the Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see two pairs of eyesthat watching him from the tree.“Look at those gold, Little John! Let’s pay the King a little visit, shall we?” Robin said.Inside the coach, the King was singing happily.“Golden Golden, I love things made of Gold… from top of my crown ‘till the tip of my toes”Robin hood were standing by the road-side as he disguised himself as a fortune teller. The King saw him and got interested. Therefore he asked ‘the lady’ to tell him about his fortune.“Ooh~ A long life with lots and lots of gold. Such a wonderful future” Robin said.“Of course! Gold is the most beautiful thing in the world” The King said excitedly. He didn’t realize that Little John is taking his gold.And so, the two manage to get all of the gold without getting caught.Meanwhile, in the village, the Sheriff was busy collecting taxes.“I must have more taxes! Hand over those gold!” the Sheriff said.“No! please don’t! We need these gold!” a girl said.“This is the king’s order! You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” the Sheriff said.“Hu huhu… No… But… uh-!” in the end, The Sheriff took the gold by force.Not long after The Sheriff left, Robin came.“What’s wrong little girl? Why are you crying?” Robin asked.“The Sheriff… He took all of our golds.” The girl said.“Oo De Lally~! you don’t have to worry then, little girl. Here, I have a lot more for you” Robin said.“this one for you, this one for you, this one for you, and this one, woops, I think I just ran out of gold. Well then, for you my lady, what about a rose?”In the end, everyone’s happy.Later then, Little John told Robin Hood that the King was having an archery tournament by tomorrow. And he promised a great prize for the winner. Hearing this, Robin Hood decided to join in. The next day, the tournament was held. It was actually not an ordinary tournament. The King was planning on capturing Robin Hood because he knew that Robin hood was good at archery.But, Robin Hood was smart. He came with another disguise so no one notice that he was Robin Hood. The tournament then soon began.Most of the contestant had failed. And now, there’s only 2 people with one of them was Robin Hood. The first contestant shot. but it didn’t hit the target. And now, it’s Robin’s turn. He takes a deep breath before then he shot. It hits the bullseye! The crowds went hype.And that is when, the Sheriff realize. “Get that man! He is Robin Hood!” he shouted. But it was all too late, because Robin Hood had successfully escaped. Unknown to the Sheriff and the king, their gold had being taken once again. After all, the tournament was only a distractionQUESTIONS1.The characters (tokoh-tokoh) 2.The problem faced by the main character (Masalah yg dihadapi tokoh utama)3.The Resolution (Resolusi) 4.The moral value (Pesan moral)​​</a>

                                            Gundala Is the Patriot We DeserveJakarta. The long-awaited new film adaptation of Gundala, a classic Indonesian comic starring its eponymous superhero, a mash up between DC Comics' "fastest man alive" The Flash and the lightning-wielding Javanese mythical hero Ki Ageng Selo, will be out on Aug. 29 with Pengabdi Setan's joko Anwar at the helm.The original comic character Gundala was created by Harya Suraminata, better known as Hasmi, in 1969. Its first movie adaptation came out in 1981 with Teddy Purba playing the titular hero. Joko's Gundala will be played by Abimana Aryasatya Joko, known for his light-gore chops in horror-thrillers such as Pintu Terlarang (The Forbidden Door) and Modus Anomali, said his version of Gundala will be different from how the superhero was depicted in the comics, but the "Son of Lightning" will remain a fearsome vigilante."The film will be about Indonesia. Pak Hasmi used his comics to satirize the government of his day. In my movie, we will see the problems all of us are facing today. Indonesia needs a patriot [to solve them]," Joko said during a media visit to the Berita Satu office on Wednesday.Abimana (Dono in Warkop DKI Reborn: ]angkrik Boss! Part l and 2, Sabtu Bersama Bapak) was joko's instant choice to play Gundala. "I wrote the script with Abimana in mind. Gundala is never selfish and always puts others before himself. Thats also the Abimana I know," Joko said.The actor found the part daunting at first, especially since joko wanted him to lose at least 10 kilograms and beef up for the role. "I gave it my best shot. This film, I think, can open the door for other [Indonesian superhero movies] . So we really pushed ourselves, we had to make this first one really good," Abimana said.The film will also star joko's muse Tara Basra (A Copy of My Mind, Pengabdi Setan) as Gundala's love interest Wulan and her alter ego, the Supergirl-like heroine Merpati, Muzakki Ramdhan as the young Gundala, and Aria Bayu (Headshot, Buffalo Boys).Tara said she had to beat 40 other contenders in the audition to get the part of Wulan/Merpati.''I'm very happy This is a film by Joko Anwar, and one that might make history," she said.A fan art competition is underway to create hype for Gundala. The best of them will be displayed during the film's premiere.Question :Identify the main idea of each paragraph. Pay attention on how ideas in the text are organized.

                                            Ini textnya :Gundala Is the Patriot We DeserveJakarta. The long-awaited new film adaptation of Gundala, a classic Indonesian comic starring its eponymous superhero, a mash up between DC Comics' "fastest man alive" The Flash and the lightning-wielding Javanese mythical hero Ki Ageng Selo, will be out on Aug. 29 with Pengabdi Setan's joko Anwar at the helm.The original comic character Gundala was created by Harya Suraminata, better known as Hasmi, in 1969. Its first movie adaptation came out in 1981 with Teddy Purba playing the titular hero. Joko's Gundala will be played by Abimana Aryasatya Joko, known for his light-gore chops in horror-thrillers such as Pintu Terlarang (The Forbidden Door) and Modus Anomali, said his version of Gundala will be different from how the superhero was depicted in the comics, but the "Son of Lightning" will remain a fearsome vigilante."The film will be about Indonesia. Pak Hasmi used his comics to satirize the government of his day. In my movie, we will see the problems all of us are facing today. Indonesia needs a patriot [to solve them]," Joko said during a media visit to the Berita Satu office on Wednesday.Abimana (Dono in Warkop DKI Reborn: ]angkrik Boss! Part l and 2, Sabtu Bersama Bapak) was joko's instant choice to play Gundala. "I wrote the script with Abimana in mind. Gundala is never selfish and always puts others before himself. Thats also the Abimana I know," Joko said.The actor found the part daunting at first, especially since joko wanted him to lose at least 10 kilograms and beef up for the role. "I gave it my best shot. This film, I think, can open the door for other [Indonesian superhero movies] . So we really pushed ourselves, we had to make this first one really good," Abimana said.The film will also star joko's muse Tara Basra (A Copy of My Mind, Pengabdi Setan) as Gundala's love interest Wulan and her alter ego, the Supergirl-like heroine Merpati, Muzakki Ramdhan as the young Gundala, and Aria Bayu (Headshot, Buffalo Boys).Tara said she had to beat 40 other contenders in the audition to get the part of Wulan/Merpati.''I'm very happy This is a film by Joko Anwar, and one that might make history," she said.A fan art competition is underway to create hype for Gundala. The best of them will be displayed during the film's premiere.Tolong bantu ya kak..​</a>

                                            ROBIN HOOD THE PRINCE OF THIEVESLong time ago, England was ruled by a greedy King. He ordered the Sheriff, to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and his friend, Little John. They would steal the tax money from sheriff and give it back to the poor.One day, the king was traveling. He was so busy counting his gold . He didn’t notice that he was passing through the Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see two pairs of eyesthat watching him from the tree.“Look at those gold, Little John! Let’s pay the King a little visit, shall we?” Robin said.Inside the coach, the King was singing happily.“Golden Golden, I love things made of Gold… from top of my crown ‘till the tip of my toes”Robin hood were standing by the road-side as he disguised himself as a fortune teller. The King saw him and got interested. Therefore he asked ‘the lady’ to tell him about his fortune.“Ooh~ A long life with lots and lots of gold. Such a wonderful future” Robin said.“Of course! Gold is the most beautiful thing in the world” The King said excitedly. He didn’t realize that Little John is taking his gold.And so, the two manage to get all of the gold without getting caught.Meanwhile, in the village, the Sheriff was busy collecting taxes.“I must have more taxes! Hand over those gold!” the Sheriff said.“No! please don’t! We need these gold!” a girl said.“This is the king’s order! You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” the Sheriff said.“Hu huhu… No… But… uh-!” in the end, The Sheriff took the gold by force.Not long after The Sheriff left, Robin came.“What’s wrong little girl? Why are you crying?” Robin asked.“The Sheriff… He took all of our golds.” The girl said.“Oo De Lally~! you don’t have to worry then, little girl. Here, I have a lot more for you” Robin said.“this one for you, this one for you, this one for you, and this one, woops, I think I just ran out of gold. Well then, for you my lady, what about a rose?”In the end, everyone’s happy.Later then, Little John told Robin Hood that the King was having an archery tournament by tomorrow. And he promised a great prize for the winner. Hearing this, Robin Hood decided to join in. The next day, the tournament was held. It was actually not an ordinary tournament. The King was planning on capturing Robin Hood because he knew that Robin hood was good at archery.But, Robin Hood was smart. He came with another disguise so no one notice that he was Robin Hood. The tournament then soon began.Most of the contestant had failed. And now, there’s only 2 people with one of them was Robin Hood. The first contestant shot. but it didn’t hit the target. And now, it’s Robin’s turn. He takes a deep breath before then he shot. It hits the bullseye! The crowds went hype.And that is when, the Sheriff realize. “Get that man! He is Robin Hood!” he shouted. But it was all too late, because Robin Hood had successfully escaped. Unknown to the Sheriff and the king, their gold had being taken once again. After all, the tournament was only a distractionQUESTIONS1.The characters (tokoh-tokoh) 2.The problem faced by the main character (Masalah yg dihadapi tokoh utama)3.The Resolution (Resolusi) 4.The moral value (Pesan moral)​​​</a>

                                            Why Owning a Home is Important Owning a home is more than just hype; it’s the gateway to long-term and short-term financial success. Long-term, you’ll build an equity nest egg and short-term, you’ll be able to enjoy potential tax breaks and pay yourself instead of a landlord. A home purchase is an investment you’ll be glad you made! There are many reasons owning a home is important, and most of them stem from the fact that a home is an asset and paying a mortgage increases your equity in that asset, which is better than paying rent. A potential increase in your credit score, tax benefits, and anticipated growth in the housing market are additional benefits to having a mortgage. Having a mortgage can help improve your credit score because a home loan adds diversity to your credit profile. Even though a mortgage is a debt, it is “good” debt, because it is tied to an asset (the house). The largest portion of your credit score is determined by your payment history, and making payments on a long-term loan like a mortgage positively contributes to your payment history. As long as you make your payments on time, your mortgage can improve your credit score by increasing your reputation as a responsible borrower. Owning a home can make a huge difference for your financial future, especially for a first-time homebuyer. While buying a home can be a transformative experience for you personally, homeownership can help you financially as well. Homeownership can lead to building your personal wealth due to home equity, or fair market value, which will likely increase over time based on both the market and any renovations you make to your home.​</a>

                                            When was the last time you were genuinely interested in or excited about going to watch an Indonesian film? Was it one that you read about and piqued your interest? Or was it one that people talked about so much on the internet that you just had to check it out?
The influence of social media on Indonesian opinions, whatever they might be on, is growing massively each year, indirectly affecting those whose work is at the mercy of those opinions.
For filmmakers and producers, there is an increasing importance for the film to pay influential people to promote their films, and also to employ individuals whose job it is to promote the film while acting naturally: a practice that has been termed “buzzing”.
But is it really effective for the industry? Apparently for some it is, but for others, marketing the content quality is more important than generating hype.
Some figures in the film industry have observed that the habits of Indonesian film-goers can be seen on social media. Usually one can find celebrities talking or writing about local films with praise, but more often than not, their followers are skeptical as to whether the praise is genuine or paid for.
Producer Susanti Dewi, responsible for films such as Bajaj Bajuri The Movie and Jakarta Undercover, noticed the tendency on Twitter to call out relatively famous people for their tweets praising a certain film.
The trend, she says, seems to be an Indonesian one, as skepticism prevails among Indonesians on the internet whenever celebrities support local films.

                                            ROBIN HOOD THE PRINCE OF THIEVESLong time ago, England was ruled by a greedy King. He ordered the Sheriff, to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and his friend, Little John. They would steal the tax money from sheriff and give it back to the poor.One day, the king was traveling. He was so busy counting his gold . He didn’t notice that he was passing through the Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see two pairs of eyesthat watching him from the tree.“Look at those gold, Little John! Let’s pay the King a little visit, shall we?” Robin said.Inside the coach, the King was singing happily.“Golden Golden, I love things made of Gold… from top of my crown ‘till the tip of my toes”Robin hood were standing by the road-side as he disguised himself as a fortune teller. The King saw him and got interested. Therefore he asked ‘the lady’ to tell him about his fortune.“Ooh~ A long life with lots and lots of gold. Such a wonderful future” Robin said.“Of course! Gold is the most beautiful thing in the world” The King said excitedly. He didn’t realize that Little John is taking his gold.And so, the two manage to get all of the gold without getting caught.Meanwhile, in the village, the Sheriff was busy collecting taxes.“I must have more taxes! Hand over those gold!” the Sheriff said.“No! please don’t! We need these gold!” a girl said.“This is the king’s order! You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” the Sheriff said.“Hu huhu… No… But… uh-!” in the end, The Sheriff took the gold by force.Not long after The Sheriff left, Robin came.“What’s wrong little girl? Why are you crying?” Robin asked.“The Sheriff… He took all of our golds.” The girl said.“Oo De Lally~! you don’t have to worry then, little girl. Here, I have a lot more for you” Robin said.“this one for you, this one for you, this one for you, and this one, woops, I think I just ran out of gold. Well then, for you my lady, what about a rose?”In the end, everyone’s happy.Later then, Little John told Robin Hood that the King was having an archery tournament by tomorrow. And he promised a great prize for the winner. Hearing this, Robin Hood decided to join in. The next day, the tournament was held. It was actually not an ordinary tournament. The King was planning on capturing Robin Hood because he knew that Robin hood was good at archery.But, Robin Hood was smart. He came with another disguise so no one notice that he was Robin Hood. The tournament then soon began.Most of the contestant had failed. And now, there’s only 2 people with one of them was Robin Hood. The first contestant shot. but it didn’t hit the target. And now, it’s Robin’s turn. He takes a deep breath before then he shot. It hits the bullseye! The crowds went hype.And that is when, the Sheriff realize. “Get that man! He is Robin Hood!” he shouted.

                            6. Gundala Is the Patriot We DeserveJakarta. The long-awaited new film adaptation of Gundala, a classic Indonesian comic starring its eponymous superhero, a mash up between DC Comics' "fastest man alive" The Flash and the lightning-wielding Javanese mythical hero Ki Ageng Selo, will be out on Aug. 29 with Pengabdi Setan's joko Anwar at the helm.The original comic character Gundala was created by Harya Suraminata, better known as Hasmi, in 1969. Its first movie adaptation came out in 1981 with Teddy Purba playing the titular hero. Joko's Gundala will be played by Abimana Aryasatya Joko, known for his light-gore chops in horror-thrillers such as Pintu Terlarang (The Forbidden Door) and Modus Anomali, said his version of Gundala will be different from how the superhero was depicted in the comics, but the "Son of Lightning" will remain a fearsome vigilante."The film will be about Indonesia. Pak Hasmi used his comics to satirize the government of his day. In my movie, we will see the problems all of us are facing today. Indonesia needs a patriot [to solve them]," Joko said during a media visit to the Berita Satu office on Wednesday.Abimana (Dono in Warkop DKI Reborn: ]angkrik Boss! Part l and 2, Sabtu Bersama Bapak) was joko's instant choice to play Gundala. "I wrote the script with Abimana in mind. Gundala is never selfish and always puts others before himself. Thats also the Abimana I know," Joko said.The actor found the part daunting at first, especially since joko wanted him to lose at least 10 kilograms and beef up for the role. "I gave it my best shot. This film, I think, can open the door for other [Indonesian superhero movies] . So we really pushed ourselves, we had to make this first one really good," Abimana said.The film will also star joko's muse Tara Basra (A Copy of My Mind, Pengabdi Setan) as Gundala's love interest Wulan and her alter ego, the Supergirl-like heroine Merpati, Muzakki Ramdhan as the young Gundala, and Aria Bayu (Headshot, Buffalo Boys).Tara said she had to beat 40 other contenders in the audition to get the part of Wulan/Merpati.''I'm very happy This is a film by Joko Anwar, and one that might make history," she said.A fan art competition is underway to create hype for Gundala. The best of them will be displayed during the film's premiere.Question :Identify the main idea of each paragraph. Pay attention on how ideas in the text are organized.

The long-awaited new film adaptation of Gundala, a classic Indonesian comic starring its eponymous superhero, a mash up between DC Comics' "fastest man alive" The Flash and the lightning-wielding Javanese mythical hero Ki Ageng Selo, will be out on Aug. 29 with Pengabdi Setan's joko Anwar at the helm.The original comic character Gundala was created by Harya Suraminata, better known as Hasmi, in 1969. Its first movie adaptation came out in 1981 with Teddy Purba playing the titular hero. Joko's Gundala will be played by Abimana Aryasatya Joko, known for his light-gore chops in horror-thrillers such as Pintu Terlarang (The Forbidden Door) and Modus Anomali, said his version of Gundala will be different from how the superhero was depicted in the comics, but the "Son of Lightning" will remain a fearsome vigilante."The film will be about Indonesia. Pak Hasmi used his comics to satirize the government of his day. In my movie, we will see the problems all of us are facing today. Indonesia needs a patriot [to solve them]," Joko said during a media visit to the Berita Satu office on Wednesday.Abimana (Dono in Warkop DKI Reborn: ]angkrik Boss! Part l and 2, Sabtu Bersama Bapak) was joko's instant choice to play Gundala. "I wrote the script with Abimana in mind. Gundala is never selfish and always puts others before himself. Thats also the Abimana I know," Joko said.The actor found the part daunting at first, especially since joko wanted him to lose at least 10 kilograms and beef up for the role. "I gave it my best shot. This film, I think, can open the door for other [Indonesian superhero movies] . So we really pushed ourselves, we had to make this first one really good," Abimana said.The film will also star joko's muse Tara Basra (A Copy of My Mind, Pengabdi Setan) as Gundala's love interest Wulan and her alter ego, the Supergirl-like heroine Merpati, Muzakki Ramdhan as the young Gundala, and Aria Bayu (Headshot, Buffalo Boys).Tara said she had to beat 40 other contenders in the audition to get the part of Wulan/Merpati.''I'm very happy This is a film by Joko Anwar, and one that might make history," she said.A fan art competition is underway to create hype for Gundala.

                            13. ROBIN HOOD THE PRINCE OF THIEVESLong time ago, England was ruled by a greedy King. He ordered the Sheriff, to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and his friend, Little John. They would steal the tax money from sheriff and give it back to the poor.One day, the king was traveling. He was so busy counting his gold . He didn’t notice that he was passing through the Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see two pairs of eyesthat watching him from the tree.“Look at those gold, Little John! Let’s pay the King a little visit, shall we?” Robin said.Inside the coach, the King was singing happily.“Golden Golden, I love things made of Gold… from top of my crown ‘till the tip of my toes”Robin hood were standing by the road-side as he disguised himself as a fortune teller. The King saw him and got interested. Therefore he asked ‘the lady’ to tell him about his fortune.“Ooh~ A long life with lots and lots of gold. Such a wonderful future” Robin said.“Of course! Gold is the most beautiful thing in the world” The King said excitedly. He didn’t realize that Little John is taking his gold.And so, the two manage to get all of the gold without getting caught.Meanwhile, in the village, the Sheriff was busy collecting taxes.“I must have more taxes! Hand over those gold!” the Sheriff said.“No! please don’t! We need these gold!” a girl said.“This is the king’s order! You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” the Sheriff said.“Hu huhu… No… But… uh-!” in the end, The Sheriff took the gold by force.Not long after The Sheriff left, Robin came.“What’s wrong little girl? Why are you crying?” Robin asked.“The Sheriff… He took all of our golds.” The girl said.“Oo De Lally~! you don’t have to worry then, little girl. Here, I have a lot more for you” Robin said.“this one for you, this one for you, this one for you, and this one, woops, I think I just ran out of gold. Well then, for you my lady, what about a rose?”In the end, everyone’s happy.Later then, Little John told Robin Hood that the King was having an archery tournament by tomorrow. And he promised a great prize for the winner. Hearing this, Robin Hood decided to join in. The next day, the tournament was held. It was actually not an ordinary tournament. The King was planning on capturing Robin Hood because he knew that Robin hood was good at archery.But, Robin Hood was smart. He came with another disguise so no one notice that he was Robin Hood. The tournament then soon began.Most of the contestant had failed. And now, there’s only 2 people with one of them was Robin Hood. The first contestant shot. but it didn’t hit the target. And now, it’s Robin’s turn. He takes a deep breath before then he shot. It hits the bullseye! The crowds went hype.And that is when, the Sheriff realize. “Get that man! He is Robin Hood!” he shouted. But it was all too late, because Robin Hood had successfully escaped. Unknown to the Sheriff and the king, their gold had being taken once again. After all, the tournament was only a distractionQUESTIONS1.The characters (tokoh-tokoh) 2.The problem faced by the main character (Masalah yg dihadapi tokoh utama)3.The Resolution (Resolusi) 4.The moral value (Pesan moral)​​​</h2><br />

                            16. Why Owning a Home is Important Owning a home is more than just hype; it’s the gateway to long-term and short-term financial success. Long-term, you’ll build an equity nest egg and short-term, you’ll be able to enjoy potential tax breaks and pay yourself instead of a landlord. A home purchase is an investment you’ll be glad you made! There are many reasons owning a home is important, and most of them stem from the fact that a home is an asset and paying a mortgage increases your equity in that asset, which is better than paying rent. A potential increase in your credit score, tax benefits, and anticipated growth in the housing market are additional benefits to having a mortgage. Having a mortgage can help improve your credit score because a home loan adds diversity to your credit profile. Even though a mortgage is a debt, it is “good” debt, because it is tied to an asset (the house). The largest portion of your credit score is determined by your payment history, and making payments on a long-term loan like a mortgage positively contributes to your payment history. As long as you make your payments on time, your mortgage can improve your credit score by increasing your reputation as a responsible borrower. Owning a home can make a huge difference for your financial future, especially for a first-time homebuyer. While buying a home can be a transformative experience for you personally, homeownership can help you financially as well. Homeownership can lead to building your personal wealth due to home equity, or fair market value, which will likely increase over time based on both the market and any renovations you make to your home.​</h2><br />

                            17. When was the last time you were genuinely interested in or excited about going to watch an Indonesian film? Was it one that you read about and piqued your interest? Or was it one that people talked about so much on the internet that you just had to check it out?
The influence of social media on Indonesian opinions, whatever they might be on, is growing massively each year, indirectly affecting those whose work is at the mercy of those opinions.
For filmmakers and producers, there is an increasing importance for the film to pay influential people to promote their films, and also to employ individuals whose job it is to promote the film while acting naturally: a practice that has been termed “buzzing”.
But is it really effective for the industry? Apparently for some it is, but for others, marketing the content quality is more important than generating hype.
Some figures in the film industry have observed that the habits of Indonesian film-goers can be seen on social media. Usually one can find celebrities talking or writing about local films with praise, but more often than not, their followers are skeptical as to whether the praise is genuine or paid for.
Producer Susanti Dewi, responsible for films such as Bajaj Bajuri The Movie and Jakarta Undercover, noticed the tendency on Twitter to call out relatively famous people for their tweets praising a certain film.
The trend, she says, seems to be an Indonesian one, as skepticism prevails among Indonesians on the internet whenever celebrities support local films.

                            18. ROBIN HOOD THE PRINCE OF THIEVESLong time ago, England was ruled by a greedy King. He ordered the Sheriff, to tax the people so heavily that some were forced to become outlaws. Two of the most famous outlaws were Robin Hood and his friend, Little John. They would steal the tax money from sheriff and give it back to the poor.One day, the king was traveling. He was so busy counting his gold . He didn’t notice that he was passing through the Sherwood Forest, the home of Robin Hood. Nor did he see two pairs of eyesthat watching him from the tree.“Look at those gold, Little John! Let’s pay the King a little visit, shall we?” Robin said.Inside the coach, the King was singing happily.“Golden Golden, I love things made of Gold… from top of my crown ‘till the tip of my toes”Robin hood were standing by the road-side as he disguised himself as a fortune teller. The King saw him and got interested. Therefore he asked ‘the lady’ to tell him about his fortune.“Ooh~ A long life with lots and lots of gold. Such a wonderful future” Robin said.“Of course! Gold is the most beautiful thing in the world” The King said excitedly. He didn’t realize that Little John is taking his gold.And so, the two manage to get all of the gold without getting caught.Meanwhile, in the village, the Sheriff was busy collecting taxes.“I must have more taxes! Hand over those gold!” the Sheriff said.“No! please don’t! We need these gold!” a girl said.“This is the king’s order! You don’t want to get arrested, do you?” the Sheriff said.“Hu huhu… No… But… uh-!” in the end, The Sheriff took the gold by force.Not long after The Sheriff left, Robin came.“What’s wrong little girl? Why are you crying?” Robin asked.“The Sheriff… He took all of our golds.” The girl said.“Oo De Lally~! you don’t have to worry then, little girl. Here, I have a lot more for you” Robin said.“this one for you, this one for you, this one for you, and this one, woops, I think I just ran out of gold. Well then, for you my lady, what about a rose?”In the end, everyone’s happy.Later then, Little John told Robin Hood that the King was having an archery tournament by tomorrow. And he promised a great prize for the winner. Hearing this, Robin Hood decided to join in. The next day, the tournament was held. It was actually not an ordinary tournament. The King was planning on capturing Robin Hood because he knew that Robin hood was good at archery.But, Robin Hood was smart. He came with another disguise so no one notice that he was Robin Hood. The tournament then soon began.Most of the contestant had failed. And now, there’s only 2 people with one of them was Robin Hood. The first contestant shot. but it didn’t hit the target. And now, it’s Robin’s turn. He takes a deep breath before then he shot. It hits the bullseye! The crowds went hype.And that is when, the Sheriff realize. “Get that man! He is Robin Hood!” he shouted. But it was all too late, because Robin Hood had successfully escaped. Unknown to the Sheriff and the king, their gold had being taken once again. After all, the tournament was only a distractionQUESTIONS1.The characters (tokoh-tokoh) 2.The problem faced by the main character (Masalah yg dihadapi tokoh utama)3.The Resolution (Resolusi) 4.The moral value (Pesan moral)​​</h2><br />
