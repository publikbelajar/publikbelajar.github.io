                                            Friendship, Love and Broken Trust...
That was the 1st day in college. As I and my friends entered the class rooms we looked around. I looked at the boys, all of them looked like all boring chaps, no one looked as though smart, someone to be friends with…, But we had to live there only.
Then came rakhi, I had to send some rakhis to my brothers. And I didnt had time to go to the courier office. One of my friend knew a boy, she asked him that if he can send those rakhis, he said yes and he took the rakhis from me and send them. I didnt even knew what was his name, then I asked my friend about him and she told me his name is aditya.When he came back I thanked him and from that day we started talking and this talking msging extended and we became the best friends.
We used to be with each other all the day long from morning till noon and after that we would be in the phone until the time we sleep and the time we wake we were again with each other. We both started loving each other, but no one told each other because both of them thought that the other done love him/her. then came a girl named garima, Aditya started liking her, I thought let them be together. I asked adi to propose her, he proposed her and she said yes. Aditya and Garima came in relationship, I just saw them being happy.
But aditya  loved me, he used to tell me, you are my wife. Even when he joked there was some reality in it, he meant it. Then after months, adi was not feeling well and garima was not with her, I just went to see him, whether he is fine or not. I sat with him, he came close to me and we smooched. Seconds later I told him, we are doing wrong, but he continued. He asked me-
“Medha u love me na?”
I said- ” are u stupid, no.”
He said-”ok”
after that he didn’t talked to me. I asked him-”are u not talking to me, just because somewhere, once I used to love u”.
He told me-”I love you too”.
And then the new romance started, we came closer to each other. We enjoyed everything, we danced, we laughed, we smiled, everything was so perfect, just the problem was Garima was still in his life. I told adi, leave me and go back to her but he didn’t.
All he  doing was just using me. No 1 knew about me and him. I told one of our common friend about both of us. she told me to leave him. But she didn’t liked him, she told Garima about both of us. Garima was just speechless, she didnt knew what to say. But adi told her, Medha just proposed me, I dont love her….:O.
Aditya broke my trust. When garima and all our common friends asked us what happened I just kept quite, aditya told everyone-” medha is telling lies, nothing of that sort happened she is just making tales, to break my relationship with garima. As I cant ever see him so I told every one that he is telling the truth, m wrong.
After sometime, everything became normal as it was, coflits continued among the 3 of us for quite some time but Aditya and Garima again came together.
I never forgave Aditya for what he did. We talk to each other, but I miss him, not as someone I loved once, but as my best friend, with whom I used to share every damn single thing of my life. Life moves but memories never fade…

Assalamu'alaikum Wr.Wb
Hello guys..did you remember about the events of 10 Nov 1945
Ok..i will tell you the short the story about the events
The moment of Indonesia to achieve independence on 17 august 1945 was not the end of the struggle. One day on the late October 1945, Brigadir Mallaby with those of 6000 British troops landed on Surabaya aiming to organize the recovery of allied prisoners of wars.
However, they also had another intention which was to take control over Surabaya and urge all Indonesian troops and militia to surrender the weapons.
“The troops ..!!! Are u all ready to attack Indonesian? ” Instructed Mallaby
“Yes, sir we are ready..” respond the troops
“Could you guarantee all the strategic has been well planned?” continued Mallaby
“Yes captain, everything is ready to bombard Surabaya.” the troops said confidently
“Now, please send this letter to Mr. Suryo “ said mallaby
The letter consist of Mallaby’s offer pointed to Mr.Suryo as the governor of East Java in order that he was willing to cooperate with his mission in taking control over Surabaya. Unfortunately, Mr. Suryo refused to cooperate with the colony. Finally, on the 9th of Novermber 1945, as soon as the tragedy causing Mallaby passed away, British Indian troops delivered ultimatum to Indonesian to surrender and give up the guns.
Otherwise, Surabaya would be bombarded. However, Indonesian ignored all kinds of threats from the Colony. This reaction then led the battle of 10 November to be occurred, which was initiated by Bung Tomo’s speech to rise the Indonesian spirit to defend Surabaya.
BUNG TOMO’S SPEECH
“ In the name of Alloh, the most compassionate, the most merciful. Merdeka…!!!
……..
Hey British troops! As long as the Indonesia bulls, the youth of Indonesia, have red blood that can make a piece of white cloth, red and white, we will never surrender.
Comrades, the people of Surabaya, be prepared! The situation is critical. However, let me remind you once more. Do not open fire until they fire at us. Let us show them all that we want a freedom.
And to us, comrades, we’d rather be devastated and destroyed that have no freedom. Our motto remains “Freedom or dead”. In the end, victory will be ours. Allah is always with the right people. Let us be assured, God will protect us all, comrades.
Allohu akbar.. Allohu akbar.. Allohu akbar.. Merdeka!!
Approximately 20.000 Indonesia troops of the newly formed people’s security army (TKR) and over 100.000 militias and irregular fighters defending the city of Surabaya.
“Women, children, all the people that pursue the right to get freedom should not deserve this destiny instead of you the colony.
Bismillahirrahmanirrohimm. For you all comrades, I promise that I will take our freedom back. I will guarantee that Indonesia is ours and no one can deny it.” Bung Tomo said enthusiastically
Finally, although Indonesia lacked of ability in using the guns, although lots of victims were fell down, Indonesia succeed to show the world that all the courage in wanting to get freedom and all the worship to the almighty god are such enough gun to win the battle.</a>

                                            Hi Lucia. How are you? It was so nice to meet you last week in Sydney at the sales meeting. How was the rest of your trip? Did you see any kangaroos? I hope you got home to Mexico City OK. Anyway, I have the documents about the new Berlin offices. We're going to be open in three months. I moved here from London just last week. They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect. There are lots of restaurants, cafés and banks in the area.

                                            Friendship, Love and Broken Trust...
That was the 1st day in college. As I and my friends entered the class rooms we looked around. I looked at the boys, all of them looked like all boring chaps, no one looked as though smart, someone to be friends with…, But we had to live there only.
Then came rakhi, I had to send some rakhis to my brothers. And I didnt had time to go to the courier office. One of my friend knew a boy, she asked him that if he can send those rakhis, he said yes and he took the rakhis from me and send them. I didnt even knew what was his name, then I asked my friend about him and she told me his name is aditya.When he came back I thanked him and from that day we started talking and this talking msging extended and we became the best friends.
We used to be with each other all the day long from morning till noon and after that we would be in the phone until the time we sleep and the time we wake we were again with each other. We both started loving each other, but no one told each other because both of them thought that the other done love him/her. then came a girl named garima, Aditya started liking her, I thought let them be together. I asked adi to propose her, he proposed her and she said yes. Aditya and Garima came in relationship, I just saw them being happy.
But aditya loved me, he used to tell me, you are my wife. Even when he joked there was some reality in it, he meant it. Then after months, adi was not feeling well and garima was not with her, I just went to see him, whether he is fine or not. I sat with him, he came close to me and we smooched. Seconds later I told him, we are doing wrong, but he continued. He asked me-
“Medha u love me na?”
I said- ” are u stupid, no.”
He said-”ok”
after that he didn’t talked to me. I asked him-”are u not talking to me, just because somewhere, once I used to love u”.
He told me-”I love you too”.
And then the new romance started, we came closer to each other. We enjoyed everything, we danced, we laughed, we smiled, everything was so perfect, just the problem was Garima was still in his life. I told adi, leave me and go back to her but he didn’t.
All he doing was just using me. No 1 knew about me and him. I told one of our common friend about both of us. she told me to leave him. But she didn’t liked him, she told Garima about both of us. Garima was just speechless, she didnt knew what to say. But adi told her, Medha just proposed me, I dont love her….:O.
Aditya broke my trust. When garima and all our common friends asked us what happened I just kept quite, aditya told everyone-” medha is telling lies, nothing of that sort happened she is just making tales, to break my relationship with garima. As I cant ever see him so I told every one that he is telling the truth, m wrong.
After sometime, everything became normal as it was, coflits continued among the 3 of us for quite some time but Aditya and Garima again came together.
I never forgave Aditya for what he did. We talk to each other, but I miss him, not as someone I loved once, but as my best friend, with whom I used to share every damn single thing of my life. Life moves but memories never fade…

Seconds later I told him, we are doing wrong, but he continued. He asked me-
“Medha u love me na?”
I said- ” are u stupid, no.”
He said-”ok”
after that he didn’t talked to me. I asked him-”are u not talking to me, just because somewhere, once I used to love u”.
He told me-”I love you too”.
And then the new romance started, we came closer to each other. We enjoyed everything, we danced, we laughed, we smiled, everything was so perfect, just the problem was Garima was still in his life. I told adi, leave me and go back to her but he didn’t.
All he doing was just using me. No 1 knew about me and him. I told one of our common friend about both of us. she told me to leave him. But she didn’t liked him, she told Garima about both of us. Garima was just speechless, she didnt knew what to say. But adi told her, Medha just proposed me, I dont love her….:O.
Aditya broke my trust. When garima and all our common friends asked us what happened I just kept quite, aditya told everyone-” medha is telling lies, nothing of that sort happened she is just making tales, to break my relationship with garima. As I cant ever see him so I told every one that he is telling the truth, m wrong.
After sometime, everything became normal as it was, coflits continued among the 3 of us for quite some time but Aditya and Garima again came together.
I never forgave Aditya for what he did. We talk to each other, but I miss him, not as someone I loved once, but as my best friend, with whom I used to share every damn single thing of my life. Life moves but memories never fade…

                            11. UNIT 11CONDITIONAL TYPE 1A. Definisi Conditional Type lCondtional Type 1 adalah salah satu jcuis Conditional Sentence yang merupakan suatu bcntuk kalimut pcngandaiun. Kalimat pcngandaian tcrscbut digunakan untuk mcnyalakan harapan tcntang sesuatu hoi seperii halnya rcncana ataupun keinginan yang mungkin akan tcrjadi atau tidak tcrjadi sama sckali baik di masa lalu, masa sckarang, dan masa yang akan datang. Ciri umum dari kalimat pcngandaian ini adalah dengan adanya real condition (kondisi yang nyata) dan unreal atau contrary to fact (kondisi yangterbalik dengan fukla yang terjudi sebenurnyu.) Conditional type 1 ini sendiri merupakan kalimat pcngandaian yang berisikan pengandaian yang tcrjadi di masa sekarang dengan harapan rencana atau keinginan tersebut akan menjadi kenyataan di masa yang akan datang. Kemungkinan dalam terwujudnya harapan suatu rencana atau keinginan tersebut sangatlah besar tcrjadi apabila pengandaian tersebut sesuai dengan fakta (realita hidup) dan bukan hanya sekedar impian belaka.B.

                            15. Friendship, Love and Broken Trust...
That was the 1st day in college. As I and my friends entered the class rooms we looked around. I looked at the boys, all of them looked like all boring chaps, no one looked as though smart, someone to be friends with…, But we had to live there only.
Then came rakhi, I had to send some rakhis to my brothers. And I didnt had time to go to the courier office. One of my friend knew a boy, she asked him that if he can send those rakhis, he said yes and he took the rakhis from me and send them. I didnt even knew what was his name, then I asked my friend about him and she told me his name is aditya.When he came back I thanked him and from that day we started talking and this talking msging extended and we became the best friends.
We used to be with each other all the day long from morning till noon and after that we would be in the phone until the time we sleep and the time we wake we were again with each other. We both started loving each other, but no one told each other because both of them thought that the other done love him/her. then came a girl named garima, Aditya started liking her, I thought let them be together. I asked adi to propose her, he proposed her and she said yes. Aditya and Garima came in relationship, I just saw them being happy.
But aditya  loved me, he used to tell me, you are my wife. Even when he joked there was some reality in it, he meant it. Then after months, adi was not feeling well and garima was not with her, I just went to see him, whether he is fine or not. I sat with him, he came close to me and we smooched. Seconds later I told him, we are doing wrong, but he continued. He asked me-
“Medha u love me na?”
I said- ” are u stupid, no.”
He said-”ok”
after that he didn’t talked to me. I asked him-”are u not talking to me, just because somewhere, once I used to love u”.
He told me-”I love you too”.
And then the new romance started, we came closer to each other. We enjoyed everything, we danced, we laughed, we smiled, everything was so perfect, just the problem was Garima was still in his life. I told adi, leave me and go back to her but he didn’t.
All he  doing was just using me. No 1 knew about me and him. I told one of our common friend about both of us. she told me to leave him. But she didn’t liked him, she told Garima about both of us. Garima was just speechless, she didnt knew what to say. But adi told her, Medha just proposed me, I dont love her….:O.
Aditya broke my trust. When garima and all our common friends asked us what happened I just kept quite, aditya told everyone-” medha is telling lies, nothing of that sort happened she is just making tales, to break my relationship with garima. As I cant ever see him so I told every one that he is telling the truth, m wrong.
After sometime, everything became normal as it was, coflits continued among the 3 of us for quite some time but Aditya and Garima again came together.
I never forgave Aditya for what he did. We talk to each other, but I miss him, not as someone I loved once, but as my best friend, with whom I used to share every damn single thing of my life. Life moves but memories never fade…

Assalamu'alaikum Wr.Wb
Hello guys..did you remember about the events of 10 Nov 1945
Ok..i will tell you the short the story about the events
The moment of Indonesia to achieve independence on 17 august 1945 was not the end of the struggle. One day on the late October 1945, Brigadir Mallaby with those of 6000 British troops landed on Surabaya aiming to organize the recovery of allied prisoners of wars.
However, they also had another intention which was to take control over Surabaya and urge all Indonesian troops and militia to surrender the weapons.
“The troops ..!!! Are u all ready to attack Indonesian? ” Instructed Mallaby
“Yes, sir we are ready..” respond the troops
“Could you guarantee all the strategic has been well planned?” continued Mallaby
“Yes captain, everything is ready to bombard Surabaya.” the troops said confidently
“Now, please send this letter to Mr. Suryo “ said mallaby
The letter consist of Mallaby’s offer pointed to Mr.Suryo as the governor of East Java in order that he was willing to cooperate with his mission in taking control over Surabaya. Unfortunately, Mr. Suryo refused to cooperate with the colony. Finally, on the 9th of Novermber 1945, as soon as the tragedy causing Mallaby passed away, British Indian troops delivered ultimatum to Indonesian to surrender and give up the guns.
Otherwise, Surabaya would be bombarded. However, Indonesian ignored all kinds of threats from the Colony. This reaction then led the battle of 10 November to be occurred, which was initiated by Bung Tomo’s speech to rise the Indonesian spirit to defend Surabaya.
BUNG TOMO’S SPEECH
“ In the name of Alloh, the most compassionate, the most merciful. Merdeka…!!!
……..
Hey British troops! As long as the Indonesia bulls, the youth of Indonesia, have red blood that can make a piece of white cloth, red and white, we will never surrender.
Comrades, the people of Surabaya, be prepared! The situation is critical. However, let me remind you once more. Do not open fire until they fire at us. Let us show them all that we want a freedom.
And to us, comrades, we’d rather be devastated and destroyed that have no freedom. Our motto remains “Freedom or dead”. In the end, victory will be ours. Allah is always with the right people. Let us be assured, God will protect us all, comrades.
Allohu akbar.. Allohu akbar.. Allohu akbar.. Merdeka!!
Approximately 20.000 Indonesia troops of the newly formed people’s security army (TKR) and over 100.000 militias and irregular fighters defending the city of Surabaya.
“Women, children, all the people that pursue the right to get freedom should not deserve this destiny instead of you the colony.
Bismillahirrahmanirrohimm. For you all comrades, I promise that I will take our freedom back. I will guarantee that Indonesia is ours and no one can deny it.” Bung Tomo said enthusiastically
Finally, although Indonesia lacked of ability in using the guns, although lots of victims were fell down, Indonesia succeed to show the world that all the courage in wanting to get freedom and all the worship to the almighty god are such enough gun to win the battle.</h2><br />

                            20. Hi Lucia. How are you? It was so nice to meet you last week in Sydney at the sales meeting. How was the rest of your trip? Did you see any kangaroos? I hope you got home to Mexico City OK. Anyway, I have the documents about the new Berlin offices. We're going to be open in three months. I moved here from London just last week. They are very nice offices, and the location is perfect. There are lots of restaurants, cafés and banks in the area. There's also public transport; we are next to an U-Bahn (that is the name for the metro here). Maybe you can come and see them one day? I would love to show you Berlin, especially in the winter.

                            29. Friendship, Love and Broken Trust...
That was the 1st day in college. As I and my friends entered the class rooms we looked around. I looked at the boys, all of them looked like all boring chaps, no one looked as though smart, someone to be friends with…, But we had to live there only.
Then came rakhi, I had to send some rakhis to my brothers. And I didnt had time to go to the courier office. One of my friend knew a boy, she asked him that if he can send those rakhis, he said yes and he took the rakhis from me and send them. I didnt even knew what was his name, then I asked my friend about him and she told me his name is aditya.When he came back I thanked him and from that day we started talking and this talking msging extended and we became the best friends.
We used to be with each other all the day long from morning till noon and after that we would be in the phone until the time we sleep and the time we wake we were again with each other. We both started loving each other, but no one told each other because both of them thought that the other done love him/her. then came a girl named garima, Aditya started liking her, I thought let them be together. I asked adi to propose her, he proposed her and she said yes. Aditya and Garima came in relationship, I just saw them being happy.
But aditya loved me, he used to tell me, you are my wife. Even when he joked there was some reality in it, he meant it. Then after months, adi was not feeling well and garima was not with her, I just went to see him, whether he is fine or not. I sat with him, he came close to me and we smooched. Seconds later I told him, we are doing wrong, but he continued. He asked me-
“Medha u love me na?”
I said- ” are u stupid, no.”
He said-”ok”
after that he didn’t talked to me. I asked him-”are u not talking to me, just because somewhere, once I used to love u”.
He told me-”I love you too”.
And then the new romance started, we came closer to each other. We enjoyed everything, we danced, we laughed, we smiled, everything was so perfect, just the problem was Garima was still in his life. I told adi, leave me and go back to her but he didn’t.
All he doing was just using me. No 1 knew about me and him. I told one of our common friend about both of us. she told me to leave him. But she didn’t liked him, she told Garima about both of us. Garima was just speechless, she didnt knew what to say. But adi told her, Medha just proposed me, I dont love her….:O.
Aditya broke my trust. When garima and all our common friends asked us what happened I just kept quite, aditya told everyone-” medha is telling lies, nothing of that sort happened she is just making tales, to break my relationship with garima. As I cant ever see him so I told every one that he is telling the truth, m wrong.
After sometime, everything became normal as it was, coflits continued among the 3 of us for quite some time but Aditya and Garima again came together.
I never forgave Aditya for what he did. We talk to each other, but I miss him, not as someone I loved once, but as my best friend, with whom I used to share every damn single thing of my life. Life moves but memories never fade…

                            33. Friendship, Love and Broken Trust...
That was the 1st day in college. As I and my friends entered the class rooms we looked around. I looked at the boys, all of them looked like all boring chaps, no one looked as though smart, someone to be friends with…, But we had to live there only.
Then came rakhi, I had to send some rakhis to my brothers. And I didnt had time to go to the courier office. One of my friend knew a boy, she asked him that if he can send those rakhis, he said yes and he took the rakhis from me and send them. I didnt even knew what was his name, then I asked my friend about him and she told me his name is aditya.When he came back I thanked him and from that day we started talking and this talking msging extended and we became the best friends.
We used to be with each other all the day long from morning till noon and after that we would be in the phone until the time we sleep and the time we wake we were again with each other. We both started loving each other, but no one told each other because both of them thought that the other done love him/her. then came a girl named garima, Aditya started liking her, I thought let them be together. I asked adi to propose her, he proposed her and she said yes. Aditya and Garima came in relationship, I just saw them being happy.
But aditya loved me, he used to tell me, you are my wife. Even when he joked there was some reality in it, he meant it. Then after months, adi was not feeling well and garima was not with her, I just went to see him, whether he is fine or not. I sat with him, he came close to me and we smooched. Seconds later I told him, we are doing wrong, but he continued. He asked me-
“Medha u love me na?”
I said- ” are u stupid, no.”
He said-”ok”
after that he didn’t talked to me. I asked him-”are u not talking to me, just because somewhere, once I used to love u”.
He told me-”I love you too”.
And then the new romance started, we came closer to each other. We enjoyed everything, we danced, we laughed, we smiled, everything was so perfect, just the problem was Garima was still in his life. I told adi, leave me and go back to her but he didn’t.
All he doing was just using me. No 1 knew about me and him. I told one of our common friend about both of us. she told me to leave him. But she didn’t liked him, she told Garima about both of us. Garima was just speechless, she didnt knew what to say. But adi told her, Medha just proposed me, I dont love her….:O.
Aditya broke my trust. When garima and all our common friends asked us what happened I just kept quite, aditya told everyone-” medha is telling lies, nothing of that sort happened she is just making tales, to break my relationship with garima. As I cant ever see him so I told every one that he is telling the truth, m wrong.
After sometime, everything became normal as it was, coflits continued among the 3 of us for quite some time but Aditya and Garima again came together.
I never forgave Aditya for what he did. We talk to each other, but I miss him, not as someone I loved once, but as my best friend, with whom I used to share every damn single thing of my life. Life moves but memories never fade…
